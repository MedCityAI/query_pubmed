INTRODUCTION: The International Hidradenitis Suppurativa Severity Score System 
(IHS4) is a validated tool that measures inflammatory lesions, including 
draining tunnels, in hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate secukinumab efficacy using IHS4 in patients with moderate 
to severe HS.
METHODS: Data from the SUNSHINE and SUNRISE trials, which assessed subcutaneous 
secukinumab 300 mg every 2 (SECQ2W) and 4 (SECQ4W) weeks in adults with moderate 
to severe HS, were analyzed. Assessments included changes from baseline in IHS4 
and severity classification up to Week 52; IHS4-55, IHS4-75, IHS4-90 responses 
(55%, 75% and 90% reduction in IHS4) and concordance between IHS4-55 and HS 
clinical response (HiSCR), at Weeks 16 and 52.
RESULTS: In total, 1084 patients (SECQ2W = 361; SECQ4W = 360; placebo = 363) 
were analyzed. At Week 16, SECQ2W and SECQ4W demonstrated a numerically higher 
reduction in IHS4 from baseline versus placebo (adjusted mean [95% CI]: -10.80 
[-12.30 to -9.30] and -9.46 [-10.96 to -7.96] vs. -4.92 [-6.43 to -3.41]); the 
reduction was maintained until Week 52 in both dose regimens. A greater 
proportion of patients achieved IHS4-55 with SECQ2W (43.4%) and SECQ4W (39.5%) 
versus placebo (31.5%) at Week 16, with further improvement at Week 52. Similar 
trends were observed for IHS4-75 and IHS4-90 responses. While no patients had 
mild disease based on IHS4 (80.7% had severe and 19.3% had moderate HS) at 
baseline, a greater proportion of patients were categorized as having mild 
disease at Week 16 in the SECQ2W (25.9%) and SECQ4W (24.0%) groups versus 
placebo (16.4%); this trend continued up to Week 52 in both dose regimens. 
Strong concordance (>85%) was observed between IHS4-55 and HiSCR.
CONCLUSIONS: Both SECQ2W and SECQ4W demonstrated efficacy in improving treatment 
response as measured by IHS4 and reducing disease severity versus placebo at 
Week 16 and these improvements were sustained through Week 52. These findings 
support that the dynamic and dichotomous IHS4 can efficiently detect treatment 
response changes in clinical trial settings.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Advancements in CT myelography (CTM) have improved 
visualization of CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs), a frequent cause of spontaneous 
intracranial hypotension (SIH). However, the relative impact of the timing of 
image acquisition and the contrast density in the subarachnoid space remains 
unclear. This study compared the effects of timing and contrast density in the 
ipsilateral subarachnoid space and assessed the impact of other technical 
factors on CVF conspicuity, using a validated instrument to stratify diagnostic 
confidence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of ICHD-3 confirmed SIH patients 
with CVFs was performed. Only fistulas classified as definite by the Duke 
CSF-Venous Fistula Confidence Score (DCCS) were included. All available CTMs 
covering each index fistula site were reviewed, excluding exams occurring after 
surgery or embolization for a definite CVF. We assigned a DCCS score to each 
acquisition and recorded contrast density in the subarachnoid space ipsilateral 
to the known CVF and image acquisition time. Patient positioning and scanner 
type were also collected as potential confounders. Ordinal logistic regression 
was used to assess associations with CVF conspicuity.
RESULTS: 144 patients with 149 definite CVFs comprised the final cohort, from 
which 222 CTMs and 697 acquisitions were assessed. Both increased contrast 
density and reduced acquisition time were associated with increased CVF 
conspicuity in univariate analyses (p<0.001). When adjusting for sex, scanner 
type, and patient positioning in the multivariate model, contrast density and 
time remained significant predictors of conspicuity (p<0.001). Density had a 
fourfold greater impact on conspicuity than time, with a 14.3% increase in 
likelihood of CVF detection per 100 HU increase in attenuation and an optimal 
target threshold at 836 HU.
CONCLUSIONS: Both contrast density and time influence conspicuity of CVFs on 
CTM; however, the greater relative impact of density suggests that myelogram 
technique should prioritize maximization of contrast density for optimal 
visualization of CVFs. Positioning strategies to increase local contrast pooling 
may improve CVF detection more effectively than timing adjustments alone.

BACKGROUND: The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and electron transport chain 
(ETC) are key metabolic pathways required for cellular ATP production. While 
loss of components in these pathways typically impairs cell survival, such 
defects can paradoxically promote tumorigenesis in certain cell types. One such 
example is loss of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which functions in both the 
TCA cycle and as Complex II of the ETC. Deleterious mutations in SDH subunits 
can cause pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PPGL), rare hereditary 
neuroendocrine tumors of chromaffin cells in the adrenal gland and the nerve 
ganglia, respectively. Why tumor formation upon SDH loss is limited to certain 
tissues remains unclear. We hypothesized that the metabolic and proteomic 
perturbations resulting from SDH loss are cell-type specific, favoring survival 
of chromaffin cells.
METHODS: We comprehensively examined the proteomic, acetylproteomic, and 
succinylproteomic effects of SDH loss in two cell models, immortalized mouse 
chromaffin cells (imCCs) and immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs). 
Perturbations in metabolite levels were determined by mass spectrometry. Effects 
of SDH loss on fatty acid β-oxidation (FAO) were assessed by stable isotope 
tracing and pharmacologic inhibition.
RESULTS: SDH-loss imCCs show significant upregulation of mitochondrial proteins, 
including TCA cycle and FAO enzymes, with pronounced downregulation of nuclear 
proteins. Both imCCs and iMEFs demonstrate significant energy deficiency upon 
SDH loss, but FAO activity is uniquely increased in SDH-loss imCCs. While SDH 
loss increases both lysine-reactive acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, SDH-loss imCCs 
and iMEFs show disproportionate hyperacetylation but mixed succinylation. 
Surprisingly, SDH-loss imCCs, but not iMEFs, display disproportionate 
hypoacetylation and hyposuccinylation of mitochondrial proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: SDH loss differentially impacts the proteomes and acylproteomes of 
imCCs and iMEFs, with compartment-specific effects. These findings reveal cell 
type-specific adaptations to SDH loss. The plasticity of the response of imCCs 
may underlie the tissue-specific susceptibility to tumorigenesis and could 
illuminate therapeutic vulnerabilities of SDH-loss tumors.

Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that have important roles in cell 
sensing, signaling and motility. Recent studies have revealed the atomic 
structures of many multicomponent ciliary complexes, elucidating their 
mechanisms of action. However, little is known about the structure, proteome and 
function of full-length radial spoke 3 (RS3), a conserved complex that transmits 
mechanochemical signals to coordinate ciliary motility. Here, we combined 
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, proteomic 
analysis and computational modeling to determine the three-dimensional structure 
and atomic model of RS3 from mouse respiratory cilia. We reveal all RS3 
components, including regulatory and metabolic enzymes such as a protein kinase 
A subunit, adenylate kinases (AKs) and malate dehydrogenases. Furthermore, we 
confirm RS3 loss in AK7-deficient mice, which exhibit motility defects. Our 
findings identify RS3 as an important regulatory and metabolic hub that 
maintains sufficient adenosine triphosphate for sustained ciliary beating, 
providing insights into the etiology of ciliopathies.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a set of immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains could 
be used to distinguish Burkitt lymphoma (BL), the quintessential B-cell lymphoma 
with a germinal center B-cell (GCB) dark zone (DZ) expression signature, from 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS). This might 
also be applicable to high-grade B-cell lymphomas (HGBCLs) with MYC and BCL2 
rearrangements (double-hit lymphomas [DHLs]) and triple-hit lymphomas (THLs).
METHODS: A 5-marker IHC algorithm was designed from gene lists that distinguish 
physiologic DZ from light zone GCBs.
RESULTS: In training and validation cohorts, we distinguished BL from DLBCL, NOS 
with high sensitivity and specificity. Because DHLs/THLs are enriched for the 
gene expression DZ signature (DZsig), we evaluated 19 DHLs/THLs and 4 HGBCLs, 
NOS. Most (83%) cases were IHC DZ. The NanoString DLBCL90 assay was performed on 
34 cases to correlate IHC DZ results with the molecular DZsig. The IHC DZ call 
was significantly associated with the DZsig (P = .0011). The sensitivity and 
specificity of IHC to recognize DZsig+ cases among DLBCL, NOS and DHLs with BCL2 
rearrangements/THLs were 91% and 100%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The IHC DZ algorithm can support a diagnosis of BL and identifies 
MYC-BCL2 DHLs/THLs with a molecular DZsig.

BACKGROUND: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) is the gold 
standard for the diagnosis and treatment of bladder tumors. Although it is a 
widely-performed urologic surgery, the complication rate and cost burden of 
TURBT is poorly understood. This study aims to assess factors contributing to 
increased complications and healthcare cost burden of TURBT.
METHODS: In this population-based cohort study using Survival Epidemiology, and 
End Results-Medicare (SEER-Medicare) registry, patients with bladder urothelial 
carcinoma (UC) who underwent a TURBT between 2004 and 2015 were queried to 
assess post-TURBT complications and costs. Multivariable logistic regression 
modeling identified factors associated with 30-day complications. Multivariable 
linear regression models compared overall costs between patients with and 
without a complication.
RESULTS: In a cohort of 72,284 patients who underwent TURBT for UC, 31,459 
(43.5%) of patients experienced at least one complication within 30 days. 
Factors associated with increased complications include male sex, larger higher 
grade/stage tumors, repeat TURBTs, concomitant stent placement, and post-TURBT 
chemotherapy. Having a complication after TURBT was significantly associated 
with increased overall Medicare cost after multivariable regression adjustment 
at 30 days ($7393 vs. $3934, P < 0.001), and at multiple time points up to 1 
year. Total 30-day Medicare costs measured $207,094,382 (median cost of $2,865 
per patient), of which 53% occurred in patients with complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Complications after TURBT account for a significant proportion of 
the cost burden of bladder cancer care. A 30-day complication was associated 
with a 47% increase in per patient Medicare costs. Future studies are needed to 
reduce complications after TURBT.

Neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's 
dementia (AD) demonstrate an ever-evolving disease continuum. The presymptomatic 
phase of neurodegenerative diseases provides a window of opportunity to detect 
disease-specific changes and abnormalities early on and potentially intervene 
right away, before clinical symptoms occur. Age and sex are key modifiers of the 
presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative diseases. In presymptomatic MS, 
younger age and male sex are main risk factors for transition to symptomatic MS, 
whereas older age and male sex are important predictors of the direct transition 
from presmyptomatic MS to primary progressive MS. In cognitively unimpaired 
adults, age is the strongest risk factor for AD and the lifetime AD risk 
after>65 years is higher in women versus men. The prevalence and future disease 
severity of AD is further modified by factors such as apolipoprotein Eɛ4, 
ovarian hormones, and menopause in women. Biomarkers are instrumental in 
detecting and monitoring abnormalities and underlying disease mechanisms in 
vivo, that are already present in the presymptomatic phase. Evaluating the 
influence of age and sex on presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative diseases, 
particularly through biomarkers, contributes to the enhanced patient selection 
for clinical trials, optimization and individualization of patient management 
and development of new therapeutics.

investigated versus best available therapy (BAT) for 3 years in patients with 
steroid-refractory/dependent chronic graft-versus-host-disease (SR/D-cGVHD). 
Patients received ruxolitinib (10 mg twice daily) or BAT for 24 weeks; 
thereafter (weeks 24-156), patients continued randomized treatment, entered 
long-term survival follow-up, or crossed over from BAT to ruxolitinib. In 329 
randomly assigned patients (ruxolitinib: 165; BAT: 164), the median failure-free 
survival (FFS) was 38.4 months for ruxolitinib versus 5.7 months for BAT (hazard 
ratio, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.27 to 0.49]). Median duration of response (DOR) was not 
reached for ruxolitinib versus 6.4 months for BAT. Ruxolitinib-treated patients 
had a higher probability of FFS (ruxolitinib: 56.5%; BAT: 18.2%) and maintaining 
a response (ruxolitinib: 59.6%; BAT: 26.7%) at 36 months. Median overall 
survival was not reached. Nonrelapse mortality and malignancy relapse/recurrence 
events were low. In 70 patients who crossed over to ruxolitinib, the overall 
response rate (50.0%) at week 24 and best overall response (81.4%) during the 
crossover period were consistent with the primary analysis of randomly assigned 
patients. No new safety signals were observed. Ruxolitinib provided longer FFS 
and DOR than BAT, demonstrating sustained efficacy and manageable safety over 3 
years of follow-up in patients with SR/D-cGVHD.

Extramedullary disease (EMD) is associated with an inferior prognosis and lower 
response rates to conventional multiple myeloma (MM)-directed therapies compared 
to MM without EMD. A deeper understanding of the molecular landscape and 
underlying drivers of EMD is essential to identify potential targets for novel 
therapeutic strategies. To address this, we performed whole-exome sequencing on 
EMD tumor tissue from 18 unique patients and bone marrow aspirates (BMAs) from 
20 patients at the time of EMD development. Notably, paired EMD and BMA samples 
were collected from 6 patients at the point of EMD diagnosis, allowing for 
direct comparison of molecular profiles. Our analysis revealed a near-universal 
presence of mutations within the MAPK pathway in EMD samples (94%), compared to 
BMAs (60%; odds ratio, 10.7; P = .02; q < 0.1). Additionally, mutations in 
established driver genes (NRAS, KRAS, and BRAF) were common and frequently 
clonal, suggesting their central role in EMD pathogenesis. We also identified 
alterations in genes associated with cell adhesion and migration (ROBO1, ROBO2, 
and FAT1) and the SWI/SNF complex and epigenetic regulators (ARID1A, KMT2C, 
KMT2D, and EP300), although these were predominantly subclonal. Furthermore, we 
frequently detected biallelic alterations in the tumor suppressor genes MAX 
(22%), a binding partner for MYC, and CDKN2C (17%). Genomic complexity was 
significantly higher in EMD samples than BMAs, as evidenced by increased tumor 
mutational burden and the enrichment of 1q gain/amplifications. These findings 
underscore the distinct molecular profile of EMD compared to BMA and highlight 
the genomically complex and heterogeneous nature of extramedullary disease in 
MM.

INTRODUCTION: Improving organ preservation is essential for expanding the donor 
pool and enhancing outcomes for pediatric transplant recipients. This report 
presents three pediatric patients who received donor hearts preserved using the 
Organ Care System (OCS). All donor hearts were prepared, placed, and monitored 
on OCS according to standard protocols. Heart function and myocardial edema were 
visually assessed during monitoring.
CASE REPORTS: Patient 1: A 17-year-old female patient with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy utilized OCS technology due to donor distance. She experienced an 
uncomplicated post-transplant course and was discharged on post-transplant day 
10. Patient 2: A 14-year-old male patient with complex congenital heart disease, 
palliated with Fontan circulation, underwent orthotopic heart transplantation 
(OHT) with OCS support due to both the complexity of the procedure and donor 
heart distance. His post-transplant course was complicated by a revision of the 
ascending aorta anastomosis and prolonged milrinone infusion for diastolic 
dysfunction. He was discharged on post-transplant day 31. Patient 3: A 
16-year-old male patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, also palliated 
with Fontan circulation, underwent OHT using OCS technology due to the 
complexity of the surgical procedure. His post-transplant recovery was 
unremarkable, and he was discharged on post-transplant day 15.
CONCLUSIONS: All three pediatric patients demonstrated favorable short-term 
outcomes using OCS technology. The OCS system facilitated shorter ischemic times 
despite the need for extended transport distances or complex surgical 
procedures. However, further studies with larger patient cohorts and longer 
follow-up are needed to better understand the long-term impact of OCS on 
pediatric heart transplantation outcomes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly, marked 
by abnormal protein buildup (beta-amyloid and tau) resulting in neuronal loss, 
especially in the medial temporal lobe and other limbic regions. The presence of 
transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) immunoreactive inclusions 
in medial temporal lobe regions has also been associated with neuroimaging 
changes in limbic regions. It has been proposed that hypometabolism in limbic 
regions on [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) in a 
patient with a slowly evolving amnestic syndrome may be a signature of the 
presence of TDP-43. In this context, we observed an 86-year-old Caucasian female 
with dementia characterized by a slowly evolving amnestic syndrome, along with 
focal medial temporal atrophy evident on MRI and hypometabolism in limbic 
regions on FDG-PET. The patient subsequently died and underwent an autopsy. We 
performed detailed neuroimaging and digital neuropathological analyses of the 
hippocampal subfields to better understand the relationship between 
clinico-imaging findings and histopathology. In addition to TDP-43, we 
identified three other pathological processes in the medial temporal lobe: 
sequestosome-1/p62, argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), and primary age-related 
tauopathy (PART). Hippocampal subfield volumes and rates of atrophy were no 
different from those of matched healthy controls, except for the atrophy rate in 
cornu ammonis 1 (CA1). Digital histopathology revealed the relative highest 
burden of pathology for p62, followed by TDP-43, AGD, and PART in CA1. Multiple 
pathological processes appear to have contributed to the hippocampal atrophy and 
hypometabolism in our patient with a slowly progressive amnestic syndrome.

BACKGROUND: Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes before or around the limit of 
fetal viability is associated with serious maternal and neonatal complications, 
including chorioamnionitis, extremely preterm birth, and pulmonary hypoplasia.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the contemporary outcomes of extremely 
preterm infants born after prolonged periviable preterm prelabor rupture of 
membranes and to identify perinatal factors associated with survival and 
survival without severe neurodevelopmental impairment.
STUDY DESIGN: Among actively treated infants born alive at <27 weeks' 
gestational age in centers of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network from 2012 to 2018, 
the outcomes of survival and survival without severe neurodevelopmental 
impairment at 22 to 26 months' corrected age were compared between infants 
exposed to prolonged (≥120 hours) periviable (<24 weeks' gestational age) 
preterm prelabor rupture of membranes and unexposed infants born after rupture 
of membranes ≤18 hours before delivery or at delivery with adjustment for birth 
gestational age, sex, multiple gestation, antenatal steroids, small for 
gestational age, insurance, and center. Regression models were used to identify 
perinatal factors associated with survival and survival without severe 
neurodevelopmental impairment among the infants exposed to prolonged periviable 
preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.
RESULTS: The analysis included 609 infants exposed to prolonged periviable 
preterm prelabor rupture of membranes and 4489 unexposed infants. In the 
prolonged periviable preterm prelabor rupture of membranes group, 444 of 608 
(73%) infants survived and 298 of 533 (56%) infants survived without severe 
neurodevelopmental impairment. The odds of survival (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.68-1.05) and survival without severe neurodevelopmental 
impairment (odds ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-1.12) were not 
significantly different between prolonged periviable preterm prelabor rupture of 
membranes and unexposed groups. The variables associated with higher odds of 
survival without severe neurodevelopmental impairment were later gestational age 
at birth (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.67), later 
gestational age at preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.26-1.63), and female sex (odds ratio, 1.57; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.06-2.34), whereas small-for-gestational-age infants had 
lower odds of survival without severe neurodevelopmental impairment (odds ratio, 
0.14; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.51).
CONCLUSION: The odds of survival and survival without severe neurodevelopmental 
impairment among infants exposed to prolonged periviable preterm prelabor 
rupture of membranes were not significantly different from those of unexposed 
infants but decreased with earlier gestational age at birth and rupture of 
membranes.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in interstitial lung disease (ILD) lacks 
approved therapies. The PVRI GoDeep meta-registry collects real-world data of PH 
patients from international PH referral centers.
METHODS: ILD-PH patients and relevant subgroups (IIP, IPF) were stratified by 
pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, adjusted 
Cox proportional hazards models, additionally accounting for immortal time bias, 
sensitivity analyses, Heller explained relative risk statistics and target trial 
emulation framework analysis were employed.
RESULTS: Among 34,482 patients, 940 hemodynamically fully characterized incident 
ILD-PH patients (median age 67[59,74] years) were identified. 62% had severe 
ILD-PH with PVR >5 WU and poor survival rates (29% and 18% at 3 and 5 years), 
significantly worse than ILD-PH patients with PVR ≤5 WU and PAH patients. 
Survival was poorest in severe IPF-PH. 59% of all ILD-PH patients received 
PH-targeted therapy, predominantly phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i). 
PDE5i-treatment was consistently associated with significantly improved survival 
in patients with severe PH (hazard ratios 0.537[0.370,0.781], 0.461[0.233,0.913] 
and 0.435[0.215,0.8] for IIP-PH, IPF-PH and IIP-PH on nintedanib/pirfenidone 
background therapy), but not in patients with less severe hemodynamic 
impairment, supported by sensitivity analyses, Heller statistics and target 
trial emulation framework analysis. The survival statistics of PDE5i-treated 
IIP-PH/IPF-PH patients were validated in the independent COMPERA registry. 
Combination therapy with PDE5i and inhaled prostacyclin analogue was superior to 
monotherapy using PDE5i (HR 0.341 [0.205, 0.566]).
CONCLUSION: Prognosis in ILD-PH was generally very poor, related to PH severity. 
PDE5i treatment in severe IIP-PH and IPF-PH was associated with improved 
survival, to be further verified in controlled trials.

OBJECTIVES: We performed a multi-institutional retrospective review of patients 
treated for juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM)-associated calcinosis to analyse the 
association between treatment outcomes and patient, disease, and treatment 
characteristics.
METHODS: Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance investigators 
searched their electronic health records for patients with JDM and calcinosis 
treated between 2003 and 2019 and analysed data at JDM diagnosis, calcinosis 
diagnosis, and calcinosis treatment. Statistical methods included univariable 
and multivariable analyses, Kaplan-Meier estimates, and multivariable Cox 
models.
RESULTS: Data were collected for 63 patients from 11 institutions. Median (IQR) 
age was 7.8 (4.1-≠11.1) years at JDM diagnosis and 9.4 (5.7-13.3) years at 
calcinosis diagnosis. Calcinosis was present at JDM diagnosis in 32% of patients 
(n=20). JDM was active in 76% of patients (47/62) at calcinosis diagnosis. 
Anti-nuclear matrix protein 2 (anti-NXP2) antibody was the most commonly 
detected myositis autoantibody (38%, 12/32). The presence of anti-NXP2 or 
anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 autoantibody did not 
significantly affect the probability of any calcinosis improvement (p=0.30). 
Patients received 103 unique treatment regimens of immunomodulatory agents with 
or without calcium-modifying agents, but those who received both had the 
greatest probability of improvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was 
associated with a significantly higher probability of calcinosis improvement 
(p=0.02) than treatments without IVIG. Overall, 79% of patients (n=50) showed 
improved calcinosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite wide variations in treatment, many patients showed 
calcinosis improvement over time, especially those treated with IVIG. Studies 
using validated outcomes assessments may be needed to develop effective 
treatment plans for JDM-associated calcinosis.

PURPOSE: Radial lengthening has been clinically proposed as an alternative 
treatment for distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) instability associated with distal 
radius fractures based on the hypothesis that it functions in a manner similar 
to ulnar shortening. This study evaluated DRUJ stability under varying degrees 
of radial lengthening and examined whether the distal oblique bundle (DOB) 
enhances its stabilizing effect.
METHODS: Eight fresh-frozen cadaver specimens were used. DRUJ translation 
distances were measured using a custom stress test machine simulating the DRUJ 
ballottement test. A triangular fibrocartilage complex injury model was created 
arthroscopically to induce DRUJ instability. Stress tests were then conducted 
after radial lengthening of 1 mm, 3 mm, and 5 mm, recording translation 
distances. Two-way analysis of variance with multiple comparison post hoc tests 
was used to determine differences under different degrees of radial lengthening 
(0-1 mm, 0-3 mm, and 0-5 mm). Finally, anatomic dissections determined the 
presence of DOB in each sample.
RESULTS: Radial lengthening did not correlate with decreased translation 
distance in machine-driven stress tests. There was a trend that greater radial 
lengthening appeared to reduce DRUJ translation distance in the presence of the 
DOB, but the power of the subgroup analysis was too limited to permit a 
statistical analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Radial lengthening did not demonstrate a benefit in improving DRUJ 
stability in a triangular fibrocartilage complex injury model. The presence of 
the DOB may influence the effectiveness of radial lengthening on DRUJ stability; 
however, further studies with larger samples are needed.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This biomechanical study did not support radial lengthening 
in improving DRUJ stability. Surgeons should be cautious in using radial 
lengthening to treat DRUJ instability associated with acute distal radius 
fractures.

Defects in homologous recombination repair (HR) make cells highly susceptible to 
PARP inhibitors. However, the limited efficacy of PARP inhibitors in targeting 
HR wild-type tumors restricts their broad utility in cancer treatment. Clinical 
trials of PARP inhibitors have revealed greater efficacy in men with metastatic 
castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) harboring BRCA2 mutations compared 
to those with mutations in other HR genes. To address this, we developed a 
peptide-based proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) drug that specifically 
targets BRCA2, leading to its degradation in a DDB1-dependent manner. The 
interaction between DDB1 and BRCA2 facilitated nuclear accumulation of the BRCA2 
peptide PROTAC (BPD), thereby promoting BRCA2 degradation in response to DNA 
damage. Combining BPD treatment with PARP inhibitors promoted cell death in 
prostate cancer cells and induced tumor regression in animal models. These 
findings suggest that development of a PROTAC drug targeting BRCA2 offers a 
promising strategy in combination with PARP inhibitor therapy for treating 
cancers without HR defects. This approach holds potential for expanding the 
therapeutic application of PARP inhibition for prostate cancer management.

Medium vessel occlusion (MeVO) contributes significantly to acute ischemic 
stroke (AIS). The hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR), reflecting collateral 
circulation via the ratio of Tmax >10s to Tmax >6s volumes, predicts infarct 
progression in large-vessel occlusions but is unstudied in MeVOs. In this 
multicenter, multinational retrospective study, we evaluated consecutive 
patients with MeVO who underwent mechanical thrombectomy with or without 
intravenous thrombolysis. Inclusion required available follow-up imaging and 
pretreatment CT perfusion. Follow-up infarct volume (FIV) was measured on CT or 
MRI 12-36 ​h post-procedure. Univariable and multivariable linear regression 
models were used to identify predictors of FIV, with HIR as the primary variable 
of interest. Among 147 patients (median age 75 years, 57 ​% female), univariable 
analysis showed HIR was significantly associated with larger FIV (β ​= ​80 ​mL; 
p ​< ​0.001). After adjusting for confounders, HIR remained independently 
associated with FIV (β ​= ​40 ​mL; p ​< ​0.001). Tmax >10 ​s showed the 
strongest correlation with FIV (r ​= ​0.56; p ​< ​0.001). These findings suggest 
that higher HIR correlates with larger infarct volumes, underscoring the 
prognostic role of collateral failure in MeVO and highlighting HIR as a 
potential imaging marker to guide treatment and outcome prediction.

A diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been considered an oncologic 
emergency. However, the prevailing wisdom to quickly administer AML-directed 
therapy is often in conflict with the time needed to complete the evaluation of 
actionable AML disease biology. Previous studies in intensively treated patients 
reported that time from date of diagnosis to treatment start date (TDT) did not 
impact survival outcomes. We conducted a US-based, multi-center, retrospective 
cohort study assessing the impact of TDT on overall survival (OS) in patients 
with newly diagnosed AML treated with hypomethylating agents (HMA) + venetoclax 
at 8 participating academic centers. 488 patients were included with a median 
age of 76 years. Patients had favorable (47.6%), intermediate (22.8%), and 
adverse (29.6%) risk disease by the 2024 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2024 
less-intensive risk classification. Median TDT for the cohort was 9 days (IQR: 
5-17). Those with TDT.

OBJECTIVE: Degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis is a common cause of back and 
leg pain influenced by factors like instability, disc degeneration, facet 
arthropathy, and psychosocial phenotype. Patients' experience of high-severity 
pain is complex, with significant implications for surgical planning. The goal 
of this study was to assess the impact of back pain catastrophizing on long-term 
outcomes following lumbar spondylolisthesis surgery.
METHODS: This study uses the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) lumbar 
spondylolisthesis dataset and includes prospectively collected data from the 12 
highest-enrolling clinical sites participating in the QOD lumbar module. The 
authors reviewed patients undergoing single-segment surgery for grade 1 
degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Severe baseline numeric rating scale for 
back pain (NRS-BP) scores (≥ 8) were classified as "catastrophizing," and mild 
to moderate pain scores (< 8) were classified as "non-catastrophizing." 
Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were compared for catastrophizing versus 
non-catastrophizing patients at 60 months. Univariate and multivariate analyses 
were conducted to assess the impact of catastrophizing on PROs, with 
multivariate analysis controlling for variables initially reaching a p value < 
0.10.
RESULTS: Of the 608 patients in this analysis, 260 (42.8%) experienced 
catastrophizing while 348 (57.2%) did not. Catastrophizing patients were 
significantly younger (59.9 ± 12.2 years vs 63.9 ± 11.7 years, p < 0.001), less 
often had ≥ 4 years of college education (31.2% vs 42.5%, p = 0.004), and more 
often used private insurance (58.8% vs 47.7%, p = 0.01). The catastrophizing 
cohort also had higher rates of depression (24.6% vs 17.0%, p = 0.02) and back 
pain predominance (45.4% vs 32.2%, p < 0.001). Surgical and perioperative 
characteristics did not significantly differ between cohorts. Although 
catastrophizing patients typically reported worse PRO scores at both baseline 
and 60 months, they demonstrated significantly greater improvement and minimal 
clinically important difference (MCID) achievement across almost all PROs at 60 
months (p < 0.05). However, North American Spine Society (NASS) satisfaction 
scores at 60 months did not differ significantly between cohorts. Multivariate 
analysis found that catastrophizing significantly predicted 60-month NRS-BP 
change (β -1.45, 95% CI -1.81 to -1.09; p < 0.001) and MCID achievement (OR 
1.98, 95% CI 1.52-2.58; p < 0.001) but not mean NRS-BP score or other metrics, 
including NASS satisfaction.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite presenting with worse baseline symptoms, patients with pain 
catastrophizing experienced substantial and clinically meaningful improvement 
following surgery for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Patient 
satisfaction was comparable between cohorts, reflecting a nuanced balance 
between greater absolute improvement and persistence of residual symptoms. These 
findings underscore that catastrophizing should not be viewed as a barrier to 
surgical success, while pointing to the need for proactive expectation setting 
and shared decision-making.

BACKGROUND: Germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in ATM increase the risk of 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) but the underlying tumor biology of PDAC 
associated with germline PVs in ATM have not been adequately explored.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Whole-genome (WGS), whole-exome (WES), and RNA-sequencing 
were performed on PDAC tumors from 25 germline ATM PVs carriers diagnosed at 
Mayo Clinic between 2007 and 2017. Somatic and copy number alterations, 
mutational signatures, transcriptomic subtypes, and the immune landscape were 
evaluated.
RESULTS: High-quality WES and WGS sequencing were obtained from 21 and 15 
tumors, respectively. Biallelic inactivation of ATM was observed in 87%, KRAS 
PVs in 90%, CDKN2A homozygous loss in 60%, and TP53 alterations in <10% of these 
tumors. A predominant clock-like mutational signature was present in all 
samples. Whole transcriptome analysis identified that the Aberrantly 
Differentiated Endocrine Exocrine (ADEX) subtype accounted for 18% of PDACs and 
was consistently associated with >5-year overall survival. In addition, a 
28-gene expression-based signature associated with OS was identified and further 
validated in the TCGA cohort. Immune landscape analysis through CODEX identified 
enriched CD4 T-helper cell/tumor interactions and reduced B7H3 high cell/tumor 
interactions in ATM PV carriers compared to non-carriers.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed absence of TP53 PVs and enrichment for CDKN2A 
alterations in ATM tumors, along with differences in the mutational signatures, 
transcriptomic subtypes and immune landscape, improve our understanding of the 
mechanistic pathways involved in PDAC development in germline ATM PV carriers 
and help identify potential targeted therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: Isotretinoin is the first line treatment for severe acne, but its 
effects on adolescent growth remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of isotretinoin on final adult height and 
height velocity in adolescents treated for acne.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the Rochester Epidemiology Project 
to identify patients diagnosed with acne between 2005-2021 who initiated 
isotretinoin or oral antibiotics before age 15. Height velocity was calculated 
using measurements taken within one year pre- and post-medication initiation, 
and final height was recorded at 18 years. Multivariable regression models 
adjusted for age and sex.
RESULTS: Among 226 isotretinoin-treated patients and 1,179 controls, final 
height did not differ significantly between groups (-0.67 cm; CI -2.21 to 0.87). 
However, isotretinoin-treated patients had a lower post-treatment height 
velocity (-0.12 cm/month; CI -0.21 to -0.04, p = 0.005) and a greater reduction 
in post- versus pre-treatment height velocity (-0.31 cm/month; CI -0.54 to 
-0.07, p = 0.011). No significant dosage effects were observed.
LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by sample size, potential unmeasured 
confounders, and a predominantly non-Hispanic white population.
CONCLUSIONS: While isotretinoin may reduce height velocity, it is not associated 
with negative effects on final adult height among adolescents treated for acne.

BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) possess therapeutic properties that 
mediate repair. Obesity impairs MSC functionality and therapeutic efficacy, 
possibly by eliciting dynamic modifications of epigenetic markers, like 
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). We hypothesized that human obesity alters the 
5hmC landscape and anti-inflammatory capacity of adipose tissue-derived MSCs to 
activate the prominent inflammatory signaling mediator Interleukin (IL)-1β.
METHODS: Adipose tissue samples were collected from obese and lean individuals 
(body mass index ≥30 or < 30kg/m2, respectively, n = 11 each) during weight-loss 
or kidney donation surgery. MSCs were harvested and analyzed for 5hmC profiles 
(MeDIP-seq) and mRNA expression (RNA-seq) (n = 5 each). Subsequently, MSCs or a 
vehicle were injected into mice, (n = 6 each) and two-weeks later, kidneys were 
evaluated using in-vivo magnetic resonance imaging and ex-vivo studies. The role 
of interleukin(IL)-1β was then studied in-vitro in MSC-induced immunomodulation 
using siRNA in macrophages.
RESULTS: Compared to MSC from lean patients, obese-MSC genes showed 2,087 
differential 5hmC modifications and 175 differential mRNA expression. Among 
them, 14 genes with overlapping alterations were involved in regulation of 
cytokine production, prominently IL-1β. Injecting obese MSCs elevated renal 
expression of IL-1β and M1 macrophage count but lowered kidney perfusion. 
Silencing IL-1β in obese-MSCs in vitro reduced M1 phenotype switching in 
co-incubated macrophages.
CONCLUSION: Obesity induces epigenetic and gene expression changes in MSCs, 
particularly in IL-1β, associated with impaired anti-inflammatory functionality 
of MSCs. Targeting IL-1β could be a useful therapeutic approach to modulate the 
decline in MSC functionality resulting from obesity.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The use of anesthesia has become commonplace in many 
procedural settings. The goal of this study is to compare sedation modalities 
used by endoscopists and anesthesiologists in the endoscopy suite, particularly 
with respect to recovery time and adverse events.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including adults (≥18 years 
of age) undergoing outpatient EGD and/or colonoscopy at Mayo Clinic in 
Jacksonville, Florida between October 1st, 2018 and December 31st, 2022. Cases 
were classified as using propofol only, propofol ± adjuvants (PA; including 
dexmedetomidine, ketamine, fentanyl, and midazolam), general anesthesia (GA) 
with endotracheal tube, or fentanyl/midazolam (FM) only. The primary outcome was 
length of stay (LOS) in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and secondary 
outcomes included the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), 
hypoxemia (Spo2 risk 90%), bradycardia (heart rate <60 bpm), and escalation of 
care (hospital admission).
RESULTS: The analysis included 56,361 cases. Among patients who received FM 
sedation, the mean PACU LOS was 52.01, 49.68, and 53.24 minutes for EGD, 
colonoscopy, and combined procedures, respectively. This was significantly 
higher than the mean PACU LOS for GA (44.65, 41.41, and 41.92 minutes, 
respectively), for PA (32.35, 35.75, and 33.42 minutes, respectively), and for 
propofol (31.63, 32.61, and 33.29 minutes, respectively; P < .0001). Of patients 
receiving FM, 8.39% experienced bradycardia, 6.12% experienced hypoxia, 0.24% 
experienced PONV, and 0.05% were hospitalized. These were substantially lower 
than the rates for other sedation groups, and odds ratios were significantly 
lower than 1.00 (P < .05) in 30 of 36 comparisons across procedural, sedative, 
and outcome categories.
CONCLUSIONS: Sedation achieved with FM correlated with a lower rate of adverse 
events but a significantly longer PACU LOS compared with propofol, PA, or GA.

Current studies regarding the secondary use of electronic health records (EHR) 
predominantly rely on domain expertise and existing medical knowledge. A 
powerful representation approach can unleash the potential of discovering new 
medical patterns underlying the EHR. Here, we introduce an unsupervised method 
for embedding high-dimensional EHR data at the patient level to characterize 
heterogeneity in complex diseases and identify novel disease patterns linked to 
disparities in clinical outcomes. We applied this approach to 34,851 unique 
medical codes across 1,046,649 longitudinal patient events, including 102,740 
patients in the Electronic Medical Records and GEnomics (eMERGE) Network. The 
model achieved strong predictive performance in predicting future disease 
(median AUROC = 0.87 within one year) and bulk phenotyping (median 
AUROC = 0.84). Notably, these patient embeddings revealed diverse comorbidity 
profiles and health outcomes, including distinct subtypes and progression 
patterns in colorectal cancer and systemic lupus erythematosus.

BACKGROUND: Preexisting diabetes (PDM) increases the risk of maternal and 
perinatal mortality and morbidity. Reduction of maternal hyperglycemia prior to 
and during pregnancy can reduce these risks. Despite compelling evidence that 
preconception care (PCC), which includes achieving strict glycemic goals, 
reduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy 
outcomes, only a minority of individuals receive PCC. Suboptimal pregnancy 
outcomes demonstrated in real-world data highlight the need to further optimize 
prenatal glycemia. New evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve 
that goal. Dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in PDM. 
The increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the 
importance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing 
medications during prenatal care for PDM.
OBJECTIVE: To provide recommendations for the care of individuals with PDM that 
lead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.
METHODS: The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) composed of a multidisciplinary 
panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and 
systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant 
questions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and 
after pregnancy. The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
evaluating the effects of different interventions (eg, PCC, nutrition, treatment 
options, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with 
diabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related 
to these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, 
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty 
of evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives 
from 2 patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and 
resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity 
of the proposed recommendations.
RESULTS: In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of 
becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy 
intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for 
pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when 
clinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence 
demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced glycated 
hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.In 
individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming 
pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | 
⊕⊕OO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, 
where PCC-including contraception as a key component-showed a clinically 
significant association with improvements in first-trimester HbA1c and the rate 
of congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general 
population regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy 
terminations with the use of contraception.In individuals with T2DM, we suggest 
discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before 
conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the 
end of the first trimester (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on limited data 
on risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy.In pregnant 
individuals with T2DM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of 
metformin (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the 
benefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for 
gestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the 
risk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related 
to changes in body composition.In individuals with PDM, we suggest either a 
carbohydrate-restricted diet (<175 g/day) or usual diet (>175 g/day) during 
pregnancy (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the 
available evidence was limited and very indirect, resulting in significant 
uncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was 
insufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate 
intake cutoff of 175 g/day.In pregnant individuals with T2DM, we suggest either 
the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood 
glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). There is lack of direct evidence supporting 
superiority of CGM use over SMBG for T2DM during pregnancy. There is indirect 
evidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals 
with T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes 
for individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for 
decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals 
with T2DM.In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a 
single 24-hour CGM target <140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care 
pregnancy glucose targets of fasting <95 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial 
<140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7 mmol/L) (2 | 
⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse 
pregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose > 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L).In individuals 
with T1DM who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed-loop pump 
(pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) rather than an insulin pump with CGM 
(without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM (2 | ⊕OOO). 
This was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated 
improvement in glucometrics with increased time in range (MD +3.81%; CI -4.24 to 
11.86) and reduced time below range (MD -0.85%; CI -1.98 to 0.28) with the use 
of hybrid closed-loop pump technology.In individuals with PDM, we suggest early 
delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management (2 | ⊕OOO). 
This was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits 
of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment 
criteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing.In individuals with PDM 
(including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum 
endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | 
⊕OOO). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was 
suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between 
PCC and both reduced HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital 
malformations.
CONCLUSION: The data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low 
certainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high 
certainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, 
during, and after pregnancy. Investment in implementation science for PCC is 
crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM 
and their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and 
refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to 
significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on 
optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research 
on timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) in 
patients with carotid stenosis may have potential effects on brain parenchyma. 
However, current studies on parenchymal changes are scarce due to the need for 
advanced imaging modalities. Consequently, the alterations in brain parenchyma 
following PTAS remain an unsolved issue.
PURPOSE: To investigate changes to the brain parenchyma using magnetic resonance 
elastography (MRE).
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
POPULATION: 13 patients (6 women and 7 men; 39 MRI imaging sessions) with severe 
unilateral carotid stenosis patients indicated for PTAS were recruited between 
2021 and 2024.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Noncontrast MRI sequences including MRE (spin echo) 
were acquired using 3 T scanners.
ASSESSMENT: All patients underwent MRE before (preprocedural), within 24 h 
(early postprocedural) and 3 months after (delayed postprocedural) PTAS. 
Preprocedural and delayed postprocedural ultrasonographic peak systolic velocity 
(PSV) was recorded. MRE stiffness and damping ratio were evaluated via neural 
network inversion of the whole brain, in 14 gray matter (GM) and 12 white matter 
(WM) regions.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Stiffness and damping ratio differences between each pair of 
MR sessions for each subject were identified by paired sample t tests. The 
correlations of stiffness and damping ratio with stenosis grade and 
ultrasonographic PSV dynamics were evaluated by Pearson correlation 
coefficients. The statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.
RESULTS: The stiffness of lesion side insula, deep GM, and deep WM increased 
significantly from preprocedural to delayed postprocedural MRE. Increasing deep 
GM stiffness on the lesion side was positively correlated with the DSA stenosis 
grade significantly (r = 0.609). The lesion side insula stiffness increments 
were positively correlated with PSV decrements significantly (r = 0.664).
DATA CONCLUSION: Regional brain stiffness increased 3 months after PTAS. Lesion 
side stiffness was positively correlated with stenosis grades in deep GM and PSV 
decrements in the insula. EVIDENCE LEVEL: 2.
TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.

Rapid shifts in evidence-based medicine challenge clinicians to adapt their 
practices based on new information. Synthesizing relevant evidence can drive 
clinical advancements. To enhance knowledge of practice-changing literature, a 
group of six internists reviewed titles and abstracts from seven internal 
medicine journals with the highest impact factors and relevance to outpatient 
general internal medicine. New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), The Lancet, 
Annals of Internal Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), 
JAMA Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal (BMJ), and Public Library of 
Science (PLoS) Medicine were reviewed. In addition, collections of article 
synopses and databases were also reviewed: American College of Physicians 
Journal Club, NEJM Journal Watch, BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine, McMaster 
ACCESSSS/DynaMed Evidence Alerts, and Cochrane Reviews. A modified Delphi method 
was used to reach consensus based on relevance to outpatient internal medicine, 
impact on practice, and strength of evidence. Articles pertaining to the same 
topic were considered together. In total,7 practice-changing articles were 
included.

OBJECTIVE: Core outcome sets (COSs) are needed to promote data consistency 
across studies as well as data synthesis and comparability. The goal of the 
current study was to utilize a modified Delphi process to develop a COS-sciatic 
injury and neuropathy evaluation (COS-SINE).
METHODS: A five-stage approach was utilized to develop the COS-SINE: stage 1, 
consortium development; stage 2, literature review to identify potential outcome 
measures; stage 3, Delphi survey to develop consensus on outcomes for inclusion; 
stage 4, Delphi survey to develop definitions; and stage 5, consensus meeting to 
finalize the COS and definitions. The study followed the Core Outcome 
Set-STAndards for Development recommendations.
RESULTS: The Core Outcomes in Nerve Surgery (COINS) Consortium comprised 23 
participants, all neurological surgeons, representing 13 countries. Three 
participants were excluded on the basis of agreed upon participation rules. The 
final COS-SINE consisted of 36 data points/outcomes covering the domains of 
demographics, diagnostics, patient-reported outcomes, motor and sensory 
outcomes, and complications. Appropriate instruments, methods of testing, and 
definitions were set. The consensus minimum duration of follow-up was 24 months, 
with consensus optimal time points for assessment identified as preoperatively 
and 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: The COINS Consortium developed a consensus COS and provided 
definitions, methods of implementation, and time points for assessment. The 
COS-SINE should serve as a minimum set of data that should be collected in all 
future neurosurgical studies on sciatic nerve injury and neuropathy. 
Incorporation of this COS should help improve consistency in reporting and data 
synthesis and comparability and should minimize outcome-reporting bias.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients who sustain a proximal humerus fracture 
(PHF) remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to find consensus 
among experts using a validated iterative process in the treatment of patients 
after a PHF.
METHODS: The Neer Circle is an organization of shoulder experts recognized for 
their service to the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons. Consensus among 86 
identified experts from this group was sought with a series of surveys using the 
Delphi process. The first 3 surveys included vignettes with 2-, 3-, and 4-part 
fractures, under 2 scenarios: (1) a healthy 55-year-old and (2) and a 
75-year-old with significant medical comorbidities. Within each vignette, 
respondents were asked about their preference on computed tomography (CT) use, 
and whether they would select operative or nonoperative treatment. A final 
survey was administered to elicit respondent preferences on general treatment 
approaches regardless of specific vignette characteristics.
RESULTS: Consensus was reached on the value of CT scans with 3D reconstructions, 
age as an important factor in determining treatment, functional demand, fracture 
pattern, bone quality, and the presence of more significant medical 
comorbidities, all of which would strongly impact decision making. Experts 
agreed that medial calcar involvement would have no impact on their decision, 
and gender and nondominant arm involvement would have a low impact. Consensus 
was reached in the following scenarios for an operative treatment in a young and 
healthy patient: 2-part shaft fracture (vignette 3, 98%), 3-part varus fracture 
(vignette 5, 98%), 3-part valgus fracture (vignette 7, 98%), 4-part fracture 
(vignette 9, 100%), 4-part dislocation fracture (vignette 11, 98%), and 4-part 
valgus impacted fractures (vignette 13, 95%); for older unhealthy patients, in 
4-part dislocation fractures (vignette 12, 100%). In the remainder of scenarios, 
there was no consensus reached for preferred treatment, either operative or 
nonoperative. Finally, there was no consensus on preferred rehabilitation 
protocols, whether for nonoperative management or postoperative care.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study demonstrates that consensus when managing 
PHFs is limited to specific scenarios, whereas lack of consensus still exists in 
others. The presented study advocates nonoperative treatment of PHFs in the 
sicker patient and surgical treatment methods for 3-part and 4-part fractures in 
the young, healthy patient.

Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation, 
play a critical role in protein trafficking, interactions, and stability. 
Disruptions in these pathways can lead to glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 
deficiencies, which present with a spectrum of clinical features, including 
congenital anomalies, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, hypotonia, and 
epilepsy. Biallelic variants in PIGV, a key mannosyltransferase in GPI 
biosynthesis, cause Hyperphosphatasia with Impaired Intellectual Development 
Syndrome 1 (HPMRS1), a rare disorder characterized by hyperphosphatasia, 
seizures, developmental delay, hypotonia, abnormal MRI findings, and distinct 
facial dysmorphisms. Fewer than 30 cases have been reported to date. We 
conducted a case study and literature review; with clinical data obtained from 
medical records. A 2-year-old female presented with developmental delay, 
myoclonic epilepsy, hypotonia, and mild facial dysmorphism. Laboratory results 
showed elevated alkaline phosphatase (899 U/L) and low pyridoxal 5'-phosphate 
levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Brain MRI revealed diffuse cerebral volume 
loss and ventriculomegaly. Trio genome sequencing identified two PIGV variants: 
c.1415T>C-p.(Leu472Pro) and c.524T>C-p.(Leu175Pro). Functional studies using 
PIGV-knockout HEK293 cells transfected with wild-type or mutant PIGV constructs 
demonstrated reduced GPI-anchored protein (GPI-AP) expression under weaker 
promoters, indicating impaired enzymatic activity. We report two novel PIGV 
variants associated with HPMRS1, emphasizing the value of functional assays in 
variant interpretation. Our findings also highlight the diagnostic relevance of 
alkaline phosphatase measurement in patients with refractory seizures.

Vasoplegia, a syndrome of noncardiogenic, non-hypovolaemic vasodilatory 
hypotension is a common complication of cardiac surgery utilising 
cardiopulmonary bypass. Vasopressor-sparing strategies have been increasingly 
used in the management of vasoplegia to minimise the untoward ischaemic and 
arrhythmogenic effects of vasoconstrictors. A recent study found that 
hydroxocobalamin, a non-vasoconstricting modulator of nitric oxide pathways, 
provided a clinically meaningful vasopressor-sparing effect in the first 24 h of 
vasoplegia. We highlight the broad implications of hydroxocobalamin in the 
management of vasoplegia associated with on-pump cardiac surgery.

This article underlines the necessity of reasonable opioid use in pain 
management, advocating for reserved prescriptions for cases where alternative 
therapies fail. It stresses comprehensive patient evaluation to balance benefits 
and risks. While opioids offer relief, it is important to utilize nonopioid 
medications, physical therapy, exercise, and other modalities in addressing 
pain. This review discusses the evolving landscape of opioid prescribing 
practices and the associated risks, highlighting the current Centers for Disease 
Control Guidelines on opioid prescribing. Additionally, it emphasizes the need 
for continuous evaluation and risk mitigation strategies to promote 
comprehensive care.

Musical training has been reported to be associated with enhanced neural 
processing of sounds, as measured via the frequency following response (FFR), 
implying the potential for human subcortical neural plasticity. We conducted a 
large-scale multi-site preregistered study (n > 260) to replicate and extend the 
findings underpinning this important relationship. We failed to replicate any of 
the major findings selected for replication that were published previously in 
smaller studies. Musical training was not associated with enhanced neural 
encoding strength of a speech stimulus (/da/) in babble, whether measured via 
the spectral or temporal representations of the FFR. Similarly, the strength of 
neural tracking of a speech sound with a dynamic pitch trajectory was not 
related to either years of musical training or age of onset of musical training. 
Our findings provide no evidence for associations between early auditory neural 
responses and either musical training or musical ability.

Head and neck xanthogranulomatous epithelial tumors/keratin-positive giant 
cell-rich tumors.

USA. Electronic address: whaley.rumeal@mayo.edu.

Xanthogranulomatous epithelial tumor (XGET) and keratin-positive giant cell-rich 
tumor (KPGCT) represent ends along the spectrum of a single neoplastic entity, 
with overlapping clinical, morphologic, immunohistochemical, and genetic 
findings (XGET/KPGCT). Morphologically, they are characterized by a highly 
variable admixture of xanthomatous histiocytes, Touton-like giant cells, 
osteoclast-like giant cells, and interspersed keratin-positive cells, which may 
be visible on routinely stained slides as clusters of eosinophilic epithelioid 
cells or require immunohistochemistry for detection. Both XGET and KPGCT harbor 
rearrangements of HMGA2, most often with NCOR2, supporting their unitary nature. 
They most often occur in young adult females, may involve either soft tissue or 
osseous locations, and behave as mesenchymal tumors of borderline malignancy, 
with risk for local recurrence but little metastatic risk. Approximately 61 
cases have been reported in the English literature, including 13 cases in the 
head and neck region. This review will summarize the known information on these 
neoplasms across anatomic sites and highlight diagnostic challenges unique to 
the head and neck region.

Immune responses underlying autoimmune diseases follow the same principles that 
protect individuals from infection and malignancies. However, while protective 
immunity wanes with progressive age, the risk for autoimmune disease steadily 
increases; incidence rates for many autoimmune diseases peak in later life. 
Here, we discuss whether aging predisposes to autoimmunity, arguing that disease 
progression in the autoimmune vasculitis giant cell arteritis is driven by 
age-inappropriate sustenance of immune competence. Stem-like memory CD4+ T cells 
(TSCM) that reside near the vasculitic lesions provide a continuous supply of 
pathogenic effector T cells. Antigen-presenting cells lacking inhibitory ligands 
further impede peripheral tolerance mechanisms. In the context of 
aging-associated accumulation of neoantigens, this incessant immune competence 
sets the stage for unopposed autoimmunity. We propose that sustained immune 
youthfulness can be detrimental to the aging host, while immune aging may be a 
beneficial adaptation to balance reactivity to self-antigens and 
non-self-antigens and thus protect from autoimmunity in aging.

Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant primary brain tumor and a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality. In 2021 the World Health Organization 
updated the classification of Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors to restrict 
glioblastomas to isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDHwt) tumors, improving 
understanding of the prognosis and optimal therapy for these tumors. This 
revision also enables more homogeneous populations of patients to be enrolled 
into clinical trials, facilitating the evaluation of novel therapies. In this 
updated consensus review from the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) and the 
European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO), the current management of 
patients with glioblastoma is discussed. In addition, novel therapies such as 
immunotherapies, viral therapies, targeted molecular therapies, theranostics and 
antibody-drug conjugates will be reviewed, as well as the current challenges and 
future directions for research.

BackgroundPatients with advanced cancer experience a substantial amount of 
existential and emotional distress. Dignity therapy (DT) is a brief, 
individualized psychotherapy that aims to relieve existential distress and 
improve the experiences of individuals impacted by serious illness.AimTo 
evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of virtual DT (vDT) among patients 
with advanced cancer.MethodsThis pilot study recruited adult patients with 
advanced cancer and an expected prognosis >6 months. The vDT intervention 
consisted of 2 sessions of guided interviews focused on life review, discussion, 
and development of a generativity document (GD). Feasibility and acceptability 
were assessed quantitatively and with semi-structured interviews. Effectiveness 
measures (distress, dignity impact scale, quality of life [QOL]) were 
administered pre/post intervention.ResultsThirty-one patients referred from a 
palliative care clinic were eligible. Twenty-one consented and 15 received a 
final GD. Patients who completed final assessments (N = 9) reported satisfaction 
with their experience and would recommend the therapy to others. Patients found 
the virtual component of the intervention acceptable, and the majority noted an 
improvement in their dignity. Qualitative analysis revealed themes of study team 
effectiveness, perspectives on intervention processes, benefits to self, and 
benefits to loved ones.ConclusionParticipation in vDT intervention was feasible 
and acceptable for patients. Patients appreciated the connection with the 
interviewer, the process, and the benefit of having a document to share with 
loved ones. Preliminary effectiveness data suggest vDT improves sense of 
dignity.

BACKGROUND: Indigenous populations worldwide experience unjust inequities in 
surgical outcomes. In Aotearoa New Zealand, Indigenous Māori experience poorer 
health outcomes, including higher rates of postoperative mortality. The aim of 
this study was to quantify ethnic disparities in 'failure to rescue' (FTR), 
complications, and mortality following gastrointestinal cancer surgery and to 
analyse trends over time.
METHODS: A retrospective national population-based cohort study of patients 
undergoing resection for gastrointestinal and hepatopancreatobiliary cancers 
from 2005 to 2020 was conducted. Self-reported ethnicity data were collected at 
the time of surgery. The primary outcome was FTR, defined as mortality following 
a complication within 90 days of surgery.
RESULTS: In total, 31 185 patients were included; 2479 (7.9%) were Māori, 46.5% 
were female, and the median age was 71 (interquartile range 62-78) years. Māori 
patients were younger and had higher levels of socio-economic deprivation and 
co-morbidity. Māori had higher age-standardized rates of mortality (5.9% versus 
3.2%), complications (52.9% versus 42.4%), and FTR (10.8% versus 7.2%), compared 
with European/Other. Multivariable regression demonstrated higher odds of 
mortality (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.45 (95% c.i. 1.15-1.82)), complications (aOR 1.30 
(95% c.i. 1.17-1.45)), and FTR (aOR 1.29 (95% c.i. 1.01-1.62)) for Māori. 
Analysis over time showed a significant improvement in risk-adjusted rates of 
mortality (6.2% in 2005-2008 versus 3.4% in 2017-2020) and FTR (7.3% in 
2005-2008 versus 4.0% in 2017-2020) for European/Other, but no change for Māori 
(rates of mortality were 6.6% in 2005-2008 versus 5.4% in 2017-2020 and rates of 
FTR were 7.8% in 2005-2008 versus 6.3% in 2017-2020).
CONCLUSION: Widening inequities in FTR have worsened disparities in 
postoperative mortality for Māori patients. 'Complication rescue' is a target to 
reduce inequities and improve perioperative care for Māori patients.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients are immunocompromised and highly 
vulnerable to serious recurrent infections. Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) 
and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) are principal sensors of pathogen challenge and are 
essential in orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses to resolve 
infection. This study identified significant deficiencies in six functionally 
distinct DC subsets in blood of untreated CLL (UT-CLL) patients and selective 
normalization of pDCs in response to acalabrutinib (a Bruton tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor) therapy. DCs are continuously replenished from hematopoiesis in bone 
marrow (BM). Four BM developmental intermediates that give rise to cDCs and pDCs 
were examined and significant reductions identified in UT-CLL patients 
supporting a precursor/progeny relationship. The deficiencies in blood DCs and 
BM DC progenitors were significantly associated with alterations in the Flt3/FL 
signaling pathway critical to DC development and function. The CLL International 
Prognostic Index (CLL-IPI), a highly accurate model to predict progression-free 
survival and time-to-first treatment (TTFT), revealed that cDC1 and pDC were 
reduced in High/Very High CLL-IPI compared to Low CLL-IPI patients. Notably, 
UT-CLL patients with shared DC subset deficiencies had shorter TTFT, uncovering 
a profound alteration in innate immunity with the potential to instruct 
therapeutic decision-making.

PURPOSE: Dose escalation for definitive radiation therapy (DE-RT) in larger 
Ewing sarcomas (ESs) is associated with a lower risk of local recurrence. We 
report treatment and toxicity outcomes in ES tumors treated with DE-RT, 
including hypofractionated approaches and size stratification of analysis.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A retrospective review of ES patients treated with DE-RT 
to doses ≥55.8 Gy was performed. Local failure (LF) with death as a competing 
risk was assessed. Maximally selected rank statistics were used to determine the 
optimal stratification of patients by survival using tumor size measurements.
RESULTS: In total, 47 patients were analyzed. Twenty-eight patients (59.6%) 
received DE-RT, of which 6 received hypofractionation. For DE-RT, median 
equivalent dose in 2 Gy fraction for α/β = 10 was 60 Gy (range, 56.2-62) with 
conventional fractionation and 62.2 Gy (range, 56.5-67.1) with 
hypofractionation. Empirically derived size cutoffs identified a subgroup of 
ultralarge tumors at higher risk of LF defined as >11.8 cm in the longest 
direction, 569.2 cm3 prechemotherapy volume, or 288.9 cm3 postchemotherapy 
volume. Five-year cumulative incidence of LF was lower in patients treated with 
DE-RT at 11.7% (95% CI, 3.16%-43.6%) versus 35.6% for non-DE-RT (95% CI, 
17.4%-72.61%; P = .098). Multivariate analysis showed trends toward DE-RT 
benefiting tumors of all sizes and stages.
CONCLUSIONS: DE-RT was associated with a trend toward better LF in all tumors 
without toxicity or plan quality changes. Ultralarge tumors demonstrated poor LF 
rates and necessitate further study.

BACKGROUND: While direct anterior approach (DAA) total hip arthroplasty (THA) 
may provide improved early outcomes versus posterior approach (PA), there are 
few clear differences in long-term objective outcomes. Studies evaluating 
subjective outcomes are lacking. This study sought to identify patient 
motivations for pursuing DAA, report whether preoperative expectations were met, 
and compare patient-reported postoperative experiences between approaches.
METHODS: A 22-question survey was administered to 33 patients who underwent 
primary PA THA followed by contralateral primary DAA THA by a different surgeon 
between 2001 and 2023 at a single institution. Subjective outcomes were 
evaluated in patients who had objectively successful THAs (exclusion criteria 
included major postoperative complications). The mean time between PA and DAA to 
survey was 12 and 5 years, respectively. There were 17 patients (52%) who 
requested contralateral DAA because they expected improved outcomes versus PA, 
while 16 patients (48%) underwent DAA for scheduling reasons.
RESULTS: There were no dislocations, infections, or reoperations after either 
approach. Mean satisfaction was similar between approaches (P = 0.14). There 
were 28 patients (85%) who preferred DAA. There were five patients who preferred 
PA who reported anterior groin pain (n = 2), lateral femoral cutaneous nerve 
pain (n = 1), delayed wound healing (n = 1), and lower satisfaction (n = 1) in 
their DAA THA. More patients reported faster recovery after DAA versus PA (n = 
26 [79%] versus n = 1 [3%]); six patients (18%) reported no difference (95% 
confidence interval: 60.6 to 90.4, 0.2 to 17.5, and 7.6 to 36.1, respectively). 
More patients reported less pain after DAA versus PA (n = 17 [52%] versus n = 3 
[9%]); 13 patients (39%) reported no difference (95% confidence interval: 33.9 
to 68.8, 2.4 to 25.5, and 23.4 to 57.8, respectively). Of those who requested 
DAA, 100% had preoperative expectations met, and 88% (n = 15) recommended DAA. 
Forgotten Joint Score was similar between approaches (P = 0.21).
CONCLUSIONS: Of those who requested DAA, 88% recommended DAA over PA, although 
Forgotten Joint Score was equivalent. Patients satisfied with PA will likely 
also be satisfied if they undergo contralateral DAA THA.

Assessment of volume status is essential in heart failure (HF) management, yet 
the relationship between cardiac filling pressures and true intravascular volume 
remains unclear, especially in patients with obesity. We analyzed 262 ambulatory 
HF patients who underwent blood volume analysis (BVA) and same-day right heart 
catheterization. Patients were stratified by BMI into non-obese (n = 104), obese 
(n = 121), and morbidly obese (n = 37). Cardiac filling pressures showed modest 
correlations with directly measured total blood volume (TBV); RAP correlated 
with TBV %deviation (r = 0.36-0.58), while PCWP correlations were weaker 
(r = 0.19-0.36) and non-significant in morbidly obese patients. Concordance 
between pressure and volume was highest in non-obese patients (RAP/TBV 79.8%, 
PCWP/TBV 69.2%) and lower in obese (66.1%, 55.4%) and morbidly obese individuals 
(64.9%, 67.6%). Approximately one-third or more of obese patients exhibited 
discordant pressure-volume profiles. These findings suggest that in obesity, 
cardiac filling pressures may not reliably reflect volume status.

The Efficacy and Safety of Technology-Guided Dry Weight Adjustment Among 
Dialysis Patients: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Recently, various instrumental techniques adjunct to 
standard clinical evaluation have been used to improve fluid balance and guide 
dry weight adjustments in dialysis populations. We aimed to explore the efficacy 
and safety of using technology-guided dry weight adjustment among dialysis 
patients.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs). The search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central 
Register of Controlled Trials for relevant RCTs published until April 28, 2024.
SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Adult patients with kidney failure with replacement 
therapy.
EXPOSURE: Studies with patients receiving technology-guided dry weight 
adjustments.
OUTCOMES: Studies were selected if they reported at least 1 outcome of interest 
(eg, mortality, cardiovascular [CV] events, hospitalization, intradialytic 
hypotension, hypovolemic events, cardiac arrhythmia, or vascular access 
problems).
ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted, with risk of 
bias within studies assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool 
for randomized trials.
RESULTS: A total of 21 RCTs involving 4,239 dialysis patients were analyzed. The 
meta-analysis revealed that the incorporating technology-guided dry weight 
adjustment not only was associated with a significant 21% reduction in CV events 
(relative risk, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.88) but also resulted 
in a significant 9% increase in muscle cramps (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 
1.02-1.16). In a subgroup analysis, using bioelectrical impedance analysis was 
associated with a significant reduction in mortality (relative risk, 0.67; 95% 
CI, 0.51-0.89). In addition, the intervention led to a significant reduction in 
pulse wave velocity (mean difference, -2.43 m/s; 95% CI, -4.64 to -0.21).
LIMITATIONS: Large number of studies with some concerns or a high risk of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Technology-guided strategies for dry weight adjustment 
significantly reduce CV events and may lower all-cause mortality in dialysis 
patients. These benefits are particularly evident with bioelectrical impedance 
analysis--guided interventions. Nonetheless, clinicians should be aware of a 
modestly increased risk of muscle cramps.

Plain Language Summary: Optimal fluid management in dialysis patients remains 
challenging in clinical practice. Because clinical evaluation alone has limited 
sensitivity in detecting subclinical volume overload, several instrumental 
techniques have been proposed to help more accurately assess dry weight in these 
patients. This meta-analysis examines the efficacy and safety of using 
technology-guided dry weight adjustment, including bioelectrical impedance 
analysis, lung ultrasound, and blood volume monitoring, compared with standard 
clinical evaluation in dialysis patients. The results showed that the use of 
these techniques has a positive effect on cardiovascular parameters, 
particularly pulse wave velocity, and reduces the risk of cardiovascular events 
in dialysis patients. However, these benefits are accompanied by an increased 
risk of muscle cramps.

BACKGROUND: Studies have shown a correlation between greater cardiorespiratory 
fitness (CRF) and lower risk of incident and recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF). 
Transthoracic echocardiographic (TTE) parameters correlate to CRF and risk of 
AF. However, there is scarce data regarding the interplay of CRF, 
echocardiographic parameters, and AF ablation outcomes. Our study sought to 
investigate how CRF and echocardiographic parameters impact AF ablation 
outcomes.
METHODS: We evaluated the Mayo Clinic Cardiorespiratory Exercise database from 
January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2017, to include all patients who 
underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing and an AF ablation in temporal 
proximity.
RESULTS: A total of 205 patients (mean age 61.2 years, 74% male) were included 
for analysis. Fitness was calculated with peak VO2 when available and exercise 
time when VO2 was not available. Lower baseline fitness correlated to larger 
left atrial volumes, lower medial mitral e' values, and higher E/e' ratios. 
Lower baseline fitness correlated to higher risk of AF recurrence post-ablation 
in a simple model, but lost significance when multiple variables were accounted 
for. Lower baseline fitness also correlated to a higher AF burden post-ablation 
at one year.
CONCLUSIONS: Lower baseline CRF likely correlates to more malignant and 
difficult to treat AF. Lower fitness also correlated to larger left atria and 
TTE parameters suggestive of diastolic dysfunction.

PURPOSE: Adhesion formation is the major complication after tendon repairs that 
halts functional restoration and causes disability in patients. This study aimed 
to compare the antiadhesion efficacy of two tendon protector sheets using a 
previously established turkey flexor tendon model.
METHODS: Twenty-four adult Bourbon Red turkeys were randomized into three 
groups: (1) control, (2) type I collagen-glycosaminoglycan (Collagen-GAG), and 
(3) hyaluronic acid. In each group, the flexor digitorum profundus tendon of the 
middle digit was sharply lacerated at the proximal interphalangeal joint level. 
All operated feet were immobilized until sacrifice 6 weeks after the surgery. 
After sacrifice, the repaired and normal digits were collected for biomechanical 
testing, adhesion scores, histological examination, and adhesion-related gene 
expression analysis.
RESULTS: At 42 days after tendon repair, the normalized work of flexion of the 
repaired digit was the lowest in the Collagen-GAG group. The Collagen-GAG group 
also had the lowest gross adhesion score, indicating minimal adhesion. The 
hyaluronic acid group showed lower adhesion scores compared with the control, 
but the difference was not statistically significant. Microscopically, the 
Collagen-GAG group had a significantly lower histological adhesion score than 
the control group. In the Collagen-GAG group, the gene expression levels of 
WNT3A, WNT5A, and WNT7A were suppressed.
CONCLUSIONS: In an avian model of flexor tendon repair, the application of 
tendon protector sheets reduces peritendinous fibrotic tissue formation 
histologically.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: There are currently limited commercially available products 
to reduce postoperative peritendinous adhesions. Further validation is needed to 
confirm the effectiveness of tendon protector sheets in improving surgical 
outcomes following tendon repairs.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of triptans in pregnant women with migraine.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We emulated a randomized clinical trial that 
hypothetically assigned patients to triptans or no triptan treatments. Data were 
retrieved from a multistate US-based health system from 2000 to 2022 on pregnant 
women with a diagnosis of migraine. We compared the effect of triptans to 
no-triptan treatments on patient-important pregnancy outcomes.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-three patients in the triptan group and 3674 
patients in the no-triptan group were included in the analysis. Of the patients 
in the triptan group, 43.74% reported full-term delivery, compared with 53.09% 
in the no-triptan group. There was no statistically significant difference 
between the groups on full-term delivery (relative risk [RR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.71 
to 1.01; absolute risk difference [RD], -0.08; 95% CI, -0.16 to 0.00), pre-term 
delivery (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.91; RD, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.11), and 
cesarean delivery (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.44; RD, 0.04; 95% CI: -0.03 to 
0.12). We found no significant differences in intrauterine growth restriction, 
fetal death/stillbirth, and major fetal malformations. Patients in the triptan 
group had no events of miscarriage and spontaneous abortions, 
eclampsia/pre-eclampsia, or tubal or ectopic pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: This target trial emulation shows that after balancing patients' 
characteristics and potential confounders, triptan use during pregnancy was not 
associated with major birth defects or other adverse birth outcomes. These data 
add to the accumulating body of evidence suggesting that triptans can be offered 
to well-informed pregnant women in need of pharmacologic therapy to abort acute 
attacks.

BACKGROUND: Tourette disorder (TS) is characterized by motor hyperactivity and 
tics that are believed to originate in the basal ganglia. Postmortem 
immunocytochemical analyses has revealed decreases in cholinergic (CH), as well 
as parvalbumin and somatostatin GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) interneurons 
(INs) within the caudate/putamen of individuals with TS.
METHODS: We obtained transcriptome and open chromatin datasets by single-nucleus 
RNA sequencing and single-nucleus ATAC sequencing, respectively, from 
caudate/putamen postmortem specimens of 6 adults with TS and 6 matched normal 
control subjects. Differential gene expression and differential chromatin 
accessibility analyses were performed in identified cell types.
RESULTS: The data reproduced the known cellular composition of the human 
striatum, including a majority of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and small 
populations of GABA-INs and CH-INs. INs were decreased by ∼50% in TS brains, 
with no difference in other cell types. Differential gene expression analysis 
suggested that mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in MSNs and synaptic adhesion 
and function in INs were both decreased in subjects with TS, while there was 
activation of immune response in microglia. Gene expression changes correlated 
with changes in activity of cis-regulatory elements, suggesting a relationship 
of transcriptomic and regulatory abnormalities in MSNs, oligodendrocytes, and 
astrocytes of TS brains.
CONCLUSIONS: This initial analysis of the TS basal ganglia transcriptome at the 
single-cell level confirms the loss and synaptic dysfunction of basal ganglia 
INs, consistent with in vivo basal ganglia hyperactivity. In parallel, oxidative 
metabolism was decreased in MSNs and correlated with activation of microglia 
cells, which is attributable at least in part to dysregulated activity of 
putative enhancers, implicating altered epigenomic regulation in TS.

There is an urgent need to improve dementia ascertainment robustness in 
real-world studies assessing drug effects on dementia risk. We developed 
algorithms to dementia identification algorithms using Medicare claims 
(inpatient/outpatient/prescription) from 3,318 Visit 5 (2011-2013) and 1,828 
Visit 6 (2016-2017) participants of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
(ARIC) Study, validated against ARIC's rigorous syndromic dementia 
classification. Algorithm performance was compared to existing algorithms (Jain, 
Bynum, Lee). We further evaluated algorithms effectiveness in a 20% random 
Medicare sample aged ≥70 who initiating liraglutide or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 
inhibitors (DPP4i) to assess 3-year adjusted risk difference (aRD) for dementia. 
Our incident dementia algorithm required two dementia diagnostic codes within 
1-year, or one dementia code plus a new dementia prescription within 90-days. It 
achieved a positive predictive value (PPV) of 69.2%, specificity of 99.0%, and 
sensitivity of 34.6% (population prevalence: 8.8%), comparable to extant 
algorithms (PPV 58.7~68.6%; sensitivity 25.5~40.4%). Prevalent dementia 
algorithm (without requiring incident diagnoses/prescriptions) demonstrated 
similar performance. In the Medicare sample, dementia risk ranged from 
3.0%-12.5%, aRD comparing liraglutide to DPP4i varied -1.2% to -3.6%, with our 
algorithm closely matching the Bynum algorithm. Algorithm selection 
significantly impacts treatment effect estimates, highlighting its importance in 
in pharmacoepidemiologic research.

The awkward trunk postures such as static flexion and twisting required of 
surgeons in the operating room are a major contributing factor to the high 
prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders amongst surgeons. One 
intervention that is currently proposed to reduce the strain associated with 
awkward intraoperative postures are passive exoskeletons worn intraoperatively. 
In this study, we measured the intraoperative postures, subjective discomfort, 
and workload as well as the usability associated with two commercially available 
exoskeletons during three types of vascular surgery and compared the results 
between a baseline (not using exoskeleton) and two different trunk exoskeletons 
(Laevo and HeroWear). A linear mixed model found that while the exoskeletons did 
not significantly interfere with surgical workflow, use of the exoskeletons did 
not significantly affect intraoperative trunk postures (28° vs. 27° vs. 34°, 
p > .05), subjective discomfort change (2.0 vs. 1.25 vs. 1.92, p = .807 in the 
low back) (3.00 vs. 1.58 vs. 2.58, p = .454 in the upper back), and (3.00 vs. 
2.75 vs. 1.92, 0.153 overall fatigue change), or workload in vascular surgeons. 
Further research on the effectiveness of exoskeletons in vascular surgeons in 
reducing discomfort and ergonomic risk factors is recommended.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether severe hyperoxia predisposes to end-organ 
complications and whether these complications contribute to in-hospital 
mortality among cardiogenic shock (CS) patients supported in veno-arterial 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO).
DESIGN: Adult patients with CS from the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization 
Registry between 2010 and 2023 were categorized into normoxia (Pa o2 60-150 mm 
Hg), mild hyperoxia (Pa o2 151-300 mm Hg), and severe hyperoxia (Pa o2 > 300 mm 
Hg) based on their Pa o2 at 24 hours. The primary outcome was in-hospital 
mortality. End-organ complications were analyzed using multivariate logistic 
regression models, and causal mediation analysis was performed to estimate the 
direct and indirect effects of hyperoxia on mortality.
SETTING: Multicenter, multinational prospective cohort study.
PATIENTS: Adults with CS supported on VA-ECMO.
INTERVENTIONS: Partial pressure of oxygen at 24 hours after VA-ECMO cannulation.
MEASUREMENTS/MAIN RESULTS: A total of 10,541 patients were included (normoxia: 
48.4%, mild hyperoxia: 30.0%, severe hyperoxia: 21.5%). There was higher 
in-hospital mortality in patients with severe hyperoxia (71.7%, adjusted OR 
[aOR]: 2.17; 95% CI, 1.19-2.50) and mild hyperoxia (63.8%, aOR: 1.34; 95% CI, 
1.19-1.50) compared normoxia (52.7%; referent group). Severe hyperoxia was 
associated with more end-organ complications, which incrementally predicted 
higher mortality (aOR: 1.42; 95% CI, 1.25-1.61). Mediation analysis demonstrated 
that hyperoxia primary exerted a direct effect on mortality (86%), with 
contributions from neurologic (3.1%), hepatic (3.9%), renal (3.5%), and bleeding 
(2.3%) complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe hyperoxia in patients with CS receiving VA-ECMO is 
associated with increased mortality and more end-organ complications. However, 
most of the effect of severe hyperoxia on mortality occurs via direct effects, 
independent of end-organ complications. These findings highlight the potential 
direct toxicity of hyperoxia and underscore the need for strategies to optimize 
oxygen delivery in this critically ill population.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause 
of hospitalization among young children. Nirsevimab is recommended for all 
infants younger than 8 months and children aged 8 to 19 months who are at 
increased risk of severe RSV entering their second RSV season. Additional data 
are necessary to identify children aged 8 to 19 months at increased risk for 
severe disease.
METHODS: The Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, a 
population-based surveillance system, captures laboratory-confirmed 
RSV-associated hospitalizations in 12 states. We compared demographics and 
clinical characteristics of children aged 0 to 23 months by age category, and of 
children aged 12 to 23 months by severity (not admitted to the intensive care 
unit [ICU], admitted to the ICU, or with prolonged [≥3 days] ICU admission) 
during the 2022-2023 season using χ2 tests and logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among 3659 randomly sampled hospitalized children in 2022-2023, 31.2%, 
40.0%, and 28.9% were aged 0 to 2, 3 to 11, and 12 to 23 months, respectively. 
Compared with children aged 0 to 2 months, children 3 to 11 and 12 to 23 months 
were more likely to have at least 1 underlying medical condition (UMC) (3.4%, 
12.6%, 23.4%, respectively; P < .05). Children aged 12 to 23 months with 
prolonged ICU admission were more likely to have airway abnormalities, 
cardiovascular disease (CVD), Down syndrome (with or without concomitant CVD), 
and feeding tube dependence than those without ICU admission (P < .05 for all).
CONCLUSIONS: UMCs were more frequently identified among hospitalized children 
aged 12 to 23 months compared with children 0 to 2 months; prolonged ICU 
admission was associated with airway abnormalities, CVD, Down syndrome, and 
feeding tube dependence.

BACKGROUND: Climate change is a pressing public health issue, with the US health 
care sector contributing about 479 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
annually. Online continuing medical education offers an alternative solution to 
increase global education delivery while reducing CO2 emissions associated with 
traditional teaching methods.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) 
emissions associated with different delivery methods of the CERTAIN (Checklist 
for Early Recognition and Treatment of Acute Illness and Injury) global critical 
care education program. Specifically, we aimed to compare the climate impact of 
local in-person courses in Rochester, MN, international in-person courses, and 
online courses to determine the potential environmental benefits of 
transitioning to digital education platforms.
METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of CO2e emissions linked to the CERTAIN 
program was conducted from 2016 to 2022. We compared the climate impact of 3 
different course offerings: local in-person at Rochester, MN, international 
in-person courses, and online courses. The international conferences were 
conducted in the host country with faculty traveling there to provide the 
educational content. CO2e emissions were calculated using the "My Climate Flight 
Calculator" and "Environmental Protection Agency Emission Factors" formulas for 
travel, conference venues, and online course-related emissions. Learner 
satisfaction was assessed via validated 5-point Likert surveys.
RESULTS: Local courses had the highest emissions: 52.7 tons/course (2.5 
tons/participant), 96% from air travel (50.6tons, P<.001), versus other formats. 
International courses showed 20.2 tons/course (0.4 tons/participant), of which 
93%(18.8 tons) were travel-related. Online courses reduced emissions by 96% per 
capita (0.1 tons/participant, P<.001) and 89% per course (5.6 tons, P<.001) 
versus local format. Overall course ratings were either excellent (live 50%, 
n=136) vs online 44%, n=11) or very good (live 30.9%, n=84 vs online 53%, n=12) 
for both live and online courses.
CONCLUSIONS: The transition to online delivery of our CERTAIN global education 
program has led to a substantial reduction in CO2 emissions, mainly by 
eliminating travel, with similar levels of learner satisfaction. These findings 
support a strategic shift toward digital medical education platforms to promote 
environmental responsibility and broaden global educational access.

BACKGROUND: Loperamide is a µ-opioid receptor agonist that reduces intestinal 
peristalsis and is used to treat diarrhea. We previously described significant 
cross-reactivity of loperamide with 2 fentanyl immunoassays. Since then, new 
fentanyl immunoassays, including a CLIA-waived point-of-care device, have been 
approved for clinical use.
METHODS: We evaluated new fentanyl immunoassays for cross-reactivity to 
loperamide and its major metabolites, N-desmethyl loperamide (dLop) and 
N-didesmethyl loperamide (ddLop). Previously characterized assays were tested 
for cross-reactivity to ddLop, which recently became commercially available. 
Loperamide, dLop, and ddLop were spiked in drug-free urine for analysis by 5 
enzyme immunoassays run on automated chemistry analyzers and one lateral flow 
assay for the detection of fentanyl.
RESULTS: Loperamide and its metabolites produced positive results in 3 fentanyl 
immunoassays. The Immunalysis HEIA was previously determined to be reactive to 
both loperamide and dLop, but it was not reactive to ddLop. The Immunalysis 
SEFRIA was reactive to loperamide, dLop, and ddLop at minimum concentrations of 
14.7 mg/L, 13.1 mg/L, and 17.0 mg/L. The Thermo Fisher DRI was previously 
determined to be reactive to loperamide and dLop, and it was reactive to ddLop 
at a minimum concentration of 33.1 mg/L. The Abbott iCassette, ARK Fentanyl II, 
and Lin-Zhi LZI II fentanyl assays showed no cross-reactivity to loperamide or 
its metabolites.
CONCLUSIONS: The cross-reactivity of loperamide, dLop, and ddLop in several 
fentanyl immunoassays has the potential to cause false-positive results during 
urine drug screening.

Introduction: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs), especially those from 
underserved communities, often face barriers to sexual and reproductive health 
(SRH). This pilot study evaluated the implementation of mobile health 
technologies to promote SRH care, including the integration of the Rapid 
Adolescent Prevention ScreeningTM (RAAPS) and the Health-E You/Salud iTuTM 
(Health-E You) app at a School-Based Health Center (SBHC) in Los Angeles using 
the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) 
framework. Methods: This multi-method pilot study included the implementation of 
an integrated tool with two components, the RAAPS electronic health screening 
tool and the Health-E You app, which delivers tailored SRH education and 
contraceptive decision support to patients (who were sex-assigned as female at 
birth) and provides an electronic summary to clinicians to better prepare them 
for the visit with their patient. Quantitative data on tool usage were collected 
directly from the back-end data storage for the apps, and qualitative data were 
obtained through semi-structured interviews and in-clinic observations. Thematic 
analysis was conducted to identify implementation barriers and facilitators. 
Results: Between April 2024 and June 2024, 60 unique patients (14-19 years of 
age) had a healthcare visit. Of these, 35.00% used the integrated RAAPS/Health-E 
You app, and 88.33% completed the Health-E You app only. All five clinic staff 
were interviewed and expressed that they valued the tools for their educational 
impact, noting that they enhanced SRH discussions and helped uncover sensitive 
information that students might not disclose face-to-face. However, the tools 
affected clinic workflows and caused rooming delays due to the time-intensive 
setup process and lack of integration with the clinic's primary electronic 
medical record system. In addition, they also reported that the time to complete 
the screener and app within the context of a 30-min appointment limited the time 
available for direct patient care. Additionally, staff reported that some 
students struggled with the two-step process and did not complete all components 
of the tool. Despite these challenges, clinic staff strongly supported renewing 
the RAAPS license and continued use of the Health-E You app, emphasizing the 
platform's potential for improving SRH care and its educational value. 
Conclusions: The integrated RAAPS and Health-E You app platform demonstrated 
educational value and improved SRH care but faced operational and technical 
barriers in implementing the tool. These findings emphasize the potential of 
such tools to address SRH disparities among vulnerable AYAs while providing a 
framework for future implementations in SBHCs.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Invasive neurostimulation is rapidly becoming an 
established option for treatment of neurologic disorders, particularly those 
that are refractory to pharmacologic treatment. However, there is limited 
information on the use of neuromodulation during pregnancy. This study explores 
the safety and clinical outcomes of invasive neuromodulation-specifically vagus 
nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and responsive 
neurostimulation (RNS)-in pregnant patients with epilepsy and movement 
disorders.
METHODS: Pregnant patients treated with VNS, DBS, or RNS were identified, and 
charts were reviewed to extract data on maternal epilepsy/movement disorder, 
treatment, and pregnancy.
RESULTS: A total of 14 patients (9 VNS, 3 DBS, 2 RNS) had 22 pregnancies. 
Neuromodulation indications included focal epilepsy (n = 6: 3 VNS, 2 RNS, 1 
DBS), generalized epilepsy (n = 6: all VNS), and Tourette syndrome (n = 2: both 
DBS). The average age at implantation was 24.7 years for VNS, 29.6 years for 
DBS, and 28 years for RNS. Pregnancy complications included miscarriages (n = 4 
pregnancies; 1 VNS, 2 DBS, 1 RNS), pre-eclampsia with fetal growth restriction 
(n = 3: 2 VNS, 1 DBS), and gestational diabetes (2 VNS). In addition, 10 
pregnancies (8 VNS, 2 RNS) were complicated by seizure exacerbations. Delivery 
of eight of the pregnancies (5 VNS, 1 DBS, 2 RNS) was by cesarean section. There 
were no cases of maternal or neonatal mortality, and there were no major 
congenital malformations. Owing to exacerbated shortness of breath during the 
third trimester, 1 patient had her VNS turned off.
DISCUSSION: Pregnancy complications were consistent with previous reports of 
patients with neurologic disorders. Despite limitations in sample size and 
confounding factors related to medication use and neurologic diagnosis, our 
study suggests that implanted neuromodulation devices do not seem to pose a risk 
of neuromodulation-related teratogenicity. While these data are promising and 
may provide some reassurance for patient counseling regarding pregnancy, further 
studies with larger sample sizes are necessary.

Herpes simplex virus type 1 replicates in the nucleus of the host cell and 
utilizes many cellular proteins to facilitate DNA replication. HSV-1 DNA 
replication is closely linked with homologous recombination, and HSV-1 encodes a 
two-subunit recombinase consisting of an exonuclease (UL12) and a single-strand 
DNA-binding protein (ICP8). We identified the cellular deubiquitinating enzyme 
USP15 as a new UL12-binding partner. USP15 is one of the most enriched proteins 
on viral DNA and has recently been implicated in regulating cellular homologous 
recombination. Utilizing isolation of proteins on nascent DNA (iPOND) to compare 
the proteins on wild-type and UL12-deficient viruses, we observed that USP15 is 
not recruited to newly replicated DNA in the absence of UL12. We also observed 
that UL12 and USP15 interact directly in vitro using purified proteins. 
Together, these data suggest that UL12 directly recruits USP15 to viral DNA. 
UL12 stimulates a type of homology-directed repair called single-strand 
annealing (SSA). We generated a USP15 knockout cell line with an integrated 
GFP-based SSA reporter and observed that UL12 and USP15 both contribute to the 
maximal induction of SSA. In addition to the reporter cell line, there is a 
10-fold reduction in the frequency of marker rescue, and individual replication 
forks move slower in the absence of USP15. These data support a role for USP15 
in facilitating recombination during the virus life cycle and the maintenance of 
replication fork stability.IMPORTANCEHSV-1 is a ubiquitous pathogen in the 
global population that causes lifelong latent infection with sporadic 
reactivation in the host. It has long been appreciated that HSV-1 DNA 
replication exhibits high rates of recombination and is linked to the host DNA 
damage response. In this study, we show a novel interaction between UL12, a 
member of the HSV recombinase, and the deubiquitinating host enzyme USP15. We 
show that USP15 physically interacts with UL12 and is required for UL12 to 
maximally stimulate recombination. In the absence of USP15, we also observe an 
overall reduction in virus growth. This work demonstrated that host proteins 
facilitate viral-induced recombination. The interaction of USP15 with UL12 
represents a potential target for intervention against HSV-1 infection and 
associated disease.

OBJECTIVE: This study establishes objective benchmarks for robotic ileal 
pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) proficiency, evaluating individual surgeon 
learning curves using risk-adjusted cumulative sum (RA-CUSUM) analysis.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: IPAA is a standard surgical treatment for conditions 
like refractory ulcerative colitis; robotic assistance offers potential 
advantages. However, the robotic IPAA learning curve is not clearly defined. 
Conventional analyses often overlook significant inter-surgeon variability and 
patient-specific factors, hindering surgical training optimization.
METHODS: A multi-site retrospective analysis of 123 consecutive robotic IPAA 
procedures performed by 11 surgeons between June 2015 and December 2023 was 
conducted. Patient-related variables were used for risk adjustment, and RA-CUSUM 
charts were generated to assess 30-day complications, operative time, and length 
of hospital stay at both aggregate and individual surgeon levels.
RESULTS: Aggregate RA-CUSUM data indicated general improvement trends for 
operative time and length of stay, alongside higher-than-expected complication 
rates in the early phase. Disaggregated analyses at the individual surgeon level 
revealed significant heterogeneity in performance trajectories and learning 
patterns across all three outcomes, directly challenging the concept of a 
standardized, uniform learning curve. Although postoperative complication and 
length of stay outcomes did not significantly differ between surgeons, operative 
time varied significantly.
CONCLUSIONS: The acquisition of skill in robotic IPAA is a highly individualized 
process, suggesting the traditional uniform learning curve model is insufficient 
for contemporary surgical education. These findings strongly advocate for a 
shift towards personalized training paradigms that incorporate deliberate 
practice, targeted feedback, and simulation to optimize learning and patient 
outcomes.

PURPOSE: Currently, there is a lack of a validated clinical sign to accurately 
detect through-and-through or complete injuries to both the dorsal and volar 
scapholunate interosseous ligament. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
validity of a clinical sign for detecting this condition.
METHODS: This study included 28 patients with suspected high-grade tears of the 
scapholunate interosseous ligament who underwent the C-sign maneuver. Each 
patient received a comprehensive evaluation, including a history, physical 
examination, magnetic resonance imaging interpretations by a musculoskeletal 
radiologist, and wrist arthroscopy. The diagnostic performance of the C-sign was 
assessed by calculating its sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, 
negative predictive value, likelihood ratios, and overall accuracy, using wrist 
arthroscopy as the reference standard.
RESULTS: The C-sign, which includes both a characteristic patient reported 
symptom and a corresponding physical examination finding, demonstrated high 
sensitivity and specificity (86% and 83%, respectively) when present together. 
The positive likelihood ratio for the C-sign was 5.18, and the negative 
likelihood ratio was 0.16. The overall diagnostic accuracy was 85.7%. The 
diagnostic performance decreased when only one component of the C-sign was 
considered alone.
CONCLUSIONS: The scapholunate C-sign is a valuable clinical indicator, 
demonstrating good diagnostic accuracy in detecting high-grade, 
through-and-through scapholunate interosseous ligament injuries that may warrant 
surgical intervention.

OBJECTIVE: Despite the availability of approved treatments, a substantial 
proportion of patients with bipolar disorder experience treatment-resistant 
bipolar depression (TRBD), characterized by persistent depressive symptoms 
unresponsive to standard therapies. However, a universally accepted definition 
of TRBD is lacking. This consensus document, developed by the International 
Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) Task Force on TRBD, aims to provide a 
standardized definition of TRBD to facilitate clinical trials, research, and 
treatment strategies.
METHODS: The Task Force employed a literature review, clinical trials analysis, 
and expert consensus meetings to define TRBD.
RESULTS: TRBD was defined as the failure to achieve a significant and sustained 
clinical response after at least two approved and adequately dosed 
pharmacological treatments, administered for a sufficient duration with 
treatment adherence. For bipolar I (BD-I) depression, approved treatments 
included quetiapine (300-600 mg/day for ≥ 8 weeks), lurasidone (20-120 mg/day 
for ≥ 6 weeks), the combination of olanzapine (6-12 mg/day) and fluoxetine 
(25-75 mg/day for ≥ 8 weeks), cariprazine (1.5-3 mg/day for ≥ 6 weeks), and 
lumateperone (42 mg/day for ≥ 6 weeks). For bipolar II (BD-II) depression, 
approved treatments included quetiapine (300-600 mg/day for ≥ 8 weeks) and 
lumateperone (42 mg/day for ≥ 6 weeks).
CONCLUSION: This consensus definition aims to provide clarity for clinical 
trials, improve consistency in research, and guide treatment approaches and 
inform regulatory pathways. It represents a foundational step in addressing the 
unmet needs in TRBD and promoting the development of innovative therapeutic 
strategies. Future efforts will focus on adapting the definition to better align 
with real-world clinical challenges and optimize patient care.

INTRODUCTION: A prognostic staging system for de novo metastatic breast cancer 
was developed by Plichta et al. We aimed to validate this system within a more 
contemporary cohort; assess model performance with respect to disease-specific 
survival (DSS), progression-free survival (PFS), and distant PFS (DPFS); and 
evaluate the impact of additional data on all possible metastatic sites.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients with stage IV breast 
cancer in our institutional cancer registry from 2010 to 2022. Kaplan-Meier 
curves with log-rank tests were used; model discrimination was estimated using 
the C-statistic. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to 
compute adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). The analysis was repeated with modified 
definitions incorporating all possible metastatic sites.
RESULTS: Overall, 425 patients were included. The staging system showed fair 
discrimination at 3 years for overall survival (OS; C-statistic 0.64), DSS 
(0.65), PFS (0.60), and DPFS (0.60). With a median follow-up of 41 months, stage 
IVA-D OS was 84%, 79%, 59%, and 47% at 3 years, respectively. Use of modified 
definitions upstaged 13.1% of patients but did not change the model fit 
(C-statistic 0.64). Patients reclassified from A/B to C/D had worse OS than 
patients remaining A/B (adjusted HR 1.59) and better survival than patients who 
were C/D under both definitions (HR 0.61).
CONCLUSIONS: The novel prognostic staging system provided meaningful 
discrimination in OS as well as for DSS, PFS, and DPFS. Inclusion of all 
metastatic sites may improve model calibration. OS has improved in more recent 
years.

As an enzyme that relaxes torsionally strained DNA, TOP1 is present in all 
nucleated human somatic cells. Even though this ubiquity makes TOP1 an unlikely 
anticancer drug target, six FDA-approved antineoplastic treatments-including two 
approved in the past five years- and a variety of experimental agents inhibit 
the TOP1 catalytic cycle. To provide insight into the continuing effort to 
develop TOP1-directed agents, here we briefly review the biology of TOP1, the 
cellular effects of stabilizing TOP1-DNA covalent complexes, mechanisms of 
resistance to TOP1 poisons, and strategies to overcome this resistance before 
describing efforts to develop TOP1 catalytic inhibitors as well as an exciting 
new generation of tumor targeting nanoparticles and antibody-drug conjugates 
that deliver TOP1-directed agents to cancers at high concentrations while 
sparing normal tissues. When paired with inhibitors of DNA damage response 
pathways, epigenetic therapies, or immune modulators, these new TOP1-directed 
agents promise to improve the therapy of a wide range of solid tumors.

shortening of the upper and/or lower limbs), hand anomalies (including 
oligodactyly, thumb aplasia or hypoplasia, syndactyly, fifth finger 
clinodactyly, hypoplasia, or aplasia), flexion contractures (involving elbows, 
wrists, knees, ankles, and feet [talipes equinovarus]), craniofacial 
abnormalities (bilateral cleft lip and/or cleft palate, micrognathia, widely 
spaced eyes, exophthalmos, downslanted palpebral fissures, malar flattening, 
underdeveloped ala nasi, and ear malformations), and ocular manifestations 
(microphthalmia, nystagmus, glaucoma, and corneal opacities). Intellectual 
disability (ranging from mild to severe) is common. Early mortality is common 
among severely affected infants; mildly affected individuals may survive to 
adulthood.
DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis of ESCO2 spectrum disorder is established in a 
proband with suggestive clinical findings and either biallelic pathogenic 
variants in ESCO2 identified by molecular genetic testing or premature 
centromere separation identified by cytogenetic testing.
MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Individualized treatment to improve 
quality of life; feeding and nutrition support; management of limb malformations 
through a multidisciplinary neuromuscular clinic including orthopedics, physical 
medicine, and physical and occupational therapy with adaptative devices, 
prostheses, therapy, stretching, night splints, and casts as needed; hand 
surgery as needed to facilitate early development of prehensile grasp and 
improve motor function; specialized bottle and surgery for cleft lip and/or 
palate; surgical treatment for craniosynostosis and micrognathia; treatment of 
ocular issues per ophthalmologist; developmental and educational support 
including speech therapy; standard treatment for ophthalmologic, cardiac, 
urogenital, and kidney abnormalities; prompt treatment of infection with 
management per infectious disease specialist; treatment of stroke per 
neurologist; treatment of malignancy per oncologist; family and social support. 
Surveillance: Assess growth, limb mobility and function, development and 
educational needs, blood pressure, frequency of infections, and home adaptation 
needs at each visit; assessment of feeding, speech development, and hearing (in 
those with cleft lip and palate) per craniofacial team; kidney function tests 
annually; follow up for ophthalmologic and cardiac anomalies per treating 
physicians; physical examination including full skin and neurologic examination 
for evidence of malignancy annually; referral to neurologist including brain 
imaging for vascular anomalies and aneurysms in those with intellectual 
disability, corneal opacities, and/or heart defects; assess for clinical 
manifestations of aneurysms and vascular malformations annually starting in 
adolescence; serum immunoglobulin levels in infancy.
GENETIC COUNSELING: ESCO2 spectrum disorder is inherited in an autosomal 
recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an ESCO2 
pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% 
chance of inheriting both pathogenic variants and being affected, a 50% chance 
of inheriting one pathogenic variant and being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 
25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the ESCO2 pathogenic 
variants have been identified in an affected family member, molecular genetic 
carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal/preimplantation genetic 
testing are possible. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is also 
possible by cytogenetic testing of fetal cells obtained by amniocentesis or 
chorionic villus sampling in conjunction with ultrasound examination.

State-of-the-art management of Dravet syndrome.

Vasquez A(1), Wirrell EC(1).

Dravet syndrome is a severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy caused by 
heterozygous, loss-of-function, pathogenic variants in the SCN1A gene. It is 
characterized by frequent, often prolonged convulsive seizures. Dravet syndrome 
is associated with diverse comorbid conditions, including developmental 
impairment, intellectual disability, and behavioral disturbances, in addition to 
high mortality rates. Prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation are essential to 
reduce seizure frequency, status epilepticus, and potentially improve 
neurodevelopmental outcomes. Currently available therapies such as fenfluramine, 
stiripentol, and cannabidiol have demonstrated significant reduction in 
convulsive seizure frequency, based on randomized controlled trials and 
real-world studies; however, they have not markedly affected non-seizure 
symptoms. Emerging therapies such as genetic modulation are promising given 
their potential for disease modification, seizure frequency reduction, and 
improvement of non-seizure outcomes. This review of observational studies and 
randomized clinical trials provides an overview of the natural history of Dravet 
syndrome, current treatment guidelines with recently approved medications, 
addressing both safety and efficacy, and new therapeutic approaches, including 
disease-modifying therapies. The therapeutic landscape in Dravet syndrome is 
evolving, with the use of new antiseizure agents and precision therapies that 
target the SCN1A variant. Goals of treatment include improvement of seizure 
burden, neurodevelopment, comorbidities, and quality of life in individuals with 
Dravet syndrome.

The Clever Hans effect occurs when machine learning models rely on spurious 
correlations instead of clinically relevant features and poses significant 
challenges to the development of reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems 
in medical imaging. This scoping review provides an overview of methods for 
identifying and addressing the Clever Hans effect in medical imaging AI 
algorithms. A total of 173 papers published between 2010 and 2024 were reviewed, 
and 37 articles were selected for detailed analysis, with classification into 
two categories: detection and mitigation approaches. Detection methods include 
model-centric, data-centric, and uncertainty and bias-based approaches, while 
mitigation strategies encompass data manipulation techniques, feature 
disentanglement and suppression, and domain knowledge-driven approaches. Despite 
the progress in detecting and mitigating the Clever Hans effect, the majority of 
current machine learning studies in medical imaging do not report or test for 
shortcut learning, highlighting the need for more rigorous validation and 
transparency in AI research. Future research should focus on creating 
standardized benchmarks, developing automated detection tools, and exploring the 
integration of detection and mitigation strategies to comprehensively address 
shortcut learning. Establishing community-driven best practices and leveraging 
interdisciplinary collaboration will be crucial for ensuring more reliable, 
generalizable, and equitable AI systems in healthcare.

BACKGROUND: Chronic neurogastroduodenal disorders are challenging to manage, 
with therapy often initiated on a trial and error basis. Prokinetics play a 
significant role in management, but responses are variable and have been 
associated with adverse events, impacting widespread use. We investigated 
whether body surface gastric mapping (BSGM) biomarkers (using Gastric Alimetry) 
could inform patient selection for prokinetic therapy.
METHODS: Patients with chronic gastroduodenal symptoms taking oral prokinetic 
agents, regardless of gastric emptying status, were prospectively recruited and 
underwent BSGM (30 m baseline, 482 kcal standardized meal, 4 h postprandial 
recording) while off-prokinetic agents. Patients were followed up with daily 
symptom diaries. A subset was compared to matched patients not taking prokinetic 
agents. Prokinetic responders were defined based on symptom improvement greater 
than a minimum clinically important difference methodology.
KEY RESULTS: Forty-two patients (88% female; median age 36; median BMI 26) 
taking prokinetics were analyzed. Prokinetic prescribing, compared to matched 
patients, was independent of BSGM metrics (p > 0.15). In patients on existing 
prokinetics (withheld for BSGM), lower amplitudes predicted reduced symptom 
burden, whereas low rhythm stability predicted a worse symptom burden 
(p < 0.05). In prokinetic-naive patients (i.e., started on a prokinetic during 
the study), a lower postprandial amplitude predicted responders (mean 
37.5 ± 10.6 uV in responders [n = 5] vs. mean 54.8 ± 6.6 uV among nonresponders 
[n = 3], p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: Gastric Alimetry biomarkers may help in the prediction of 
prokinetic response in patients with chronic gastroduodenal symptoms. Lower 
postprandial amplitudes, indicating a reduced meal response, appear to predict 
benefit, while impaired rhythm stability predicted poorer therapeutic response.

INTRODUCTION: Rituximab (RTX) therapy has become the standard of care for 
treatment of membranous nephropathy (MN). However, data on hard outcomes such as 
end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR), are lacking.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study on all patients with MN treated with RTX 
between January 2000 and December 2022. The primary outcomes were ESKD and eGFR 
loss > 50%. Clinical outcomes were complete remission (CR), partial remission 
(PR) (reduction in baseline proteinuria ≥ 50% and proteinuria ≤ 3.5 g/24 h), and 
immunological remission (IR) (serum antiphospholipase A receptor antibody 
[PLA2R-Ab] depletion).
RESULTS: A total of 159 patients were included (75.5% male, 87.4% White, median 
age: 58 years); 52.8% had previous immunosuppression (IS). Baseline serum 
creatinine was 1.50 (1.1-1.9) mg/dl, eGFR was 54.6 (37.4-72.5) ml/min per 1.73 
m2, proteinuria was 9.2 (6.7-11.9) g/24 h, and serum albumin was 2.7 (2.2-3.2) 
g/dl; Of the patients, 108 (75.5%) had PLA2R-Ab-associated MN (PLA2R-MN); and 
140 of 159 (88.1%) attained CR or PR. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) time to 
CR and PR were 22.6 (15.5-37.4) and 6.8 (3.6-12.1) months, respectively. Failure 
to respond to RTX was observed in 11.9% of patients. Previous IS and 
interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA) ≥ 25% were independent factors 
associated with failure to respond to RTX. Patients treated only with RTX with a 
median follow-up of 62.6 months; 7 of 159 (4.4%) developed ESKD with an 
estimated renal survival of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 94%-100%) and 
95.4% (95% CI: 91.2%-99%) at 5 and 10 years, respectively.
CONCLUSION: RTX treatment is associated with excellent long-term renal survival 
that compares favorably with historical survival rates using the cyclic 
corticosteroids/cyclophosphamide regimen.

Monoclonal Gammopathy in ANCA-Negative Pauci-immune Crescentic 
Glomerulonephritis: Is There an Association?

BACKGROUND: In a small subset of patients with pauci-immune crescentic 
glomerulonephritis (PICGN), antinuclear cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are not 
identified, and patients are referred to as having 'ANCA-negative' vasculitis. 
The cause of the disease in this subset of patients has remained elusive. We 
explored the role of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) in those with ANCA-negative 
PICGN.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study and identified patients with PICGN 
who had undergone ANCA and monoclonal testing. Those positive for ANCA were 
excluded.
RESULTS: We identified 14 patients with ANCA-negative vasculitis, of whom 8 
(57%) tested positive for MG with a mean age of 60.3 ± 12.2 years, 75% female, 
and a mean serum creatinine of 4.3 ± 1.92 mg/dL. The most common monoclonal 
proteins were IgG (n=4, 50%) and Kappa (n=4, 50%). One patient had diagnosis of 
multiple myeloma. Most common extra-renal manifestations were skin rash 
(leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV)) and neuropathy. Kidney biopsy showed a 
higher degree of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy compared to those 
without MG. The median follow-up time was 3.2 years, with 50% mortality in those 
with MG.
CONCLUSIONS: Over 50% of the patients with ANCA-negative PICGN have MG, and 
patients present with more evidence of fibrosis on kidney biopsy, with higher 
mortality rate observed in our cohort Monoclonal proteins may trigger 
development of PICGN their specific role in the pathogenesis of this disease 
needs further investigation.

Pediatric Database.

TA(1), Larson AN(1).

BACKGROUND: Pediatric orthopaedic surgery encompasses many areas of 
subspecialization. To improve patient care, quality improvement efforts should 
focus on high-volume procedures with high complication rates. This study aims to 
identify these procedures to better target research and quality-improvement 
initiatives.
METHODS: Patients undergoing one of the 30 most common orthopaedic procedures in 
NSQIP pediatric data from 2012 to 2022 were analyzed for 30-day complications, 
infections, unplanned reoperations, and unplanned readmissions. Multivariable 
models assessed associations between procedure type and adverse events, adjusted 
for patient characteristics. Tibial osteotomy (TO) was defined as the reference 
category for procedure in each model as it is a common procedure with a moderate 
risk profile and a similar complication rate across the cohort.
RESULTS: 191,381 patients were included in the analysis (median: 10 y, IQR: 5 to 
13; 48.7% male). The 30-day overall complication rate was 2.3% (n=4401), with 
infections occurring in 1.6% of cases (n=3005). Unplanned reoperations occurred 
in 1.7% (n=3207), and the unplanned readmission rate was 2.0% per 30 
person-days. The most performed procedures were posterior spine fusion (PSF; 
n=45,542; 23.8%), supracondylar humeral fracture (SCHfx) repair (n=45,479; 
23.8%). Complication rates were highest for PSF in non-idiopathic cases (10.3%), 
followed by pelvic and femoral osteotomy (4.9%). Infectious complications were 
most frequent in PSF for non-idiopathic cases (6.1%) and tibial osteotomy 
(3.1%). Unplanned reoperation rates were elevated for non-idiopathic PSF (5.6%) 
and pelvic/femoral osteotomy (4.9%). On multivariable analysis, PSF for 
adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (OR=1.39; 95% CI: 1.05-1.86) and non-idiopathic 
causes (OR=2.16; 95% CI: 1.61-1.89) demonstrated increased odds of complications 
compared with TO. Factors associated with higher complication rates included BMI 
>95th percentile (OR=1.52; 95% CI: 1.40-1.65), developmental delay (OR=1.57; 95% 
CI: 1.43-1.73), seizure disorder (OR=1.41; 95% CI: 1.27-1.56), and ASA ≥2 
(OR=2.14;95% CI: 1.90-2.41). Although PSF for non-idiopathic causes had the 
highest unplanned readmission rates (9.4% per 30 person-days), adjusted analysis 
showed a strong association with increased readmissions for pelvic/femoral 
osteotomy (HR=2.52; 95% CI: 1.58-4.03) compared with TO. SCHfx repair and 
calcaneal osteotomy consistently had lower rates of complications, infections, 
reoperations, and readmissions.
CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for covariates, PSF and tibial and femoral 
osteotomies, demonstrated significantly higher risks for adverse surgical 
outcomes compared with TO. Our findings identify SCHfx repair as a high-volume 
procedure with low complication, infection, reoperation, and readmission rates 
in contrast to PSF, one of the most common procedures with the highest 
complication rate.

Post-traumatic Triradiate Cartilage Physeal Bar Excision with 3D Navigation: A 
Case Report.

Varas-Rodriguez E(1), Yuan BJ, Milbrandt TA, Grigoriou E.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.

CASE: An 8-year-old boy underwent open reduction and internal fixation for 
pelvic and femoral fractures following a crush injury. At nine months 
postoperatively, computed tomography demonstrated a triradiate physeal bar 
contralateral to operated hemipelvis. A navigated physeal bar excision with 
O-arm navigation and low-dose radiation protocol was performed.
CONCLUSION: Triradiate bar excision presents a technically challenging procedure 
that may be offset by O-arm navigation utilization, which provides accurate, 
real-time imaging that facilitates complete physeal bar excision while 
mitigating risk of damage to surrounding structures. Our low-dose protocol 
yielded a total exposure of 0.914 mSv, comparable with 1.5 pelvic radiographs.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended surveillance 
imaging intervals for uveal melanoma (UM) based on the risk of distant 
metastasis. The objective of this research is to evaluate if patients, treated 
at our tertiary cancer center, who had scans consistent with these guidelines, 
had improved overall survival (OS). This was a single-center, retrospective 
study of UM patients, who developed metastatic disease. Patients were grouped 
into risk-of-metastasis cohorts (low, medium, and high-risk) based on the UM 
NCCN guidelines v1.2023. The frequency of scans was reported within annual 
intervals for 5 years within the low-risk cohort and for 10 years within the 
medium-risk cohort, and within 6-month intervals for the first 5 years and then 
annually in years 6-10 within the high-risk cohort. Conditional landmark 
analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between OS and consistency with 
guidelines. Scan frequency was evaluated against socioeconomic status. Of the 
740 UM patients identified (1997-2020), 110 experienced metastasis and comprised 
our analysis population (20 low-risk; 67 medium-risk; and 23 high-risk). The 
median time to death (95% confidence interval) from diagnosis of metastasis was 
similar between the low, medium, and high-risk cohorts at 1.2 (1.0, 2.0), 2.0 
(1.7, 2.6), and 1.6 (1.3, 2.3) years, respectively. For each cohort, the OS 
results were similar between those who followed guidelines vs. not at each 
annual landmark time. Living in disadvantaged areas did not impact imaging 
frequency (all P > 0.05). Imaging at intervals outlined by the NCCN guidelines 
v1.2023 did not impact OS for patients who developed metastatic UM.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is widely used to treat high-risk 
breast cancer. However, the optimal time to surgery (TTS) following NAC remains 
undefined. This study investigates the impact of TTS on oncologic outcomes using 
the I-SPY 2 Trial cohort.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 1877 patients with breast cancer enrolled 
in the I-SPY 2 Trial was performed. Patients were grouped by TTS post-NAC: 
1-4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6-8 weeks, and 9 + weeks. Baseline demographic, clinical, 
imaging, and treatment response data were collected. Event-free survival (EFS) 
and local recurrence-free interval (LRFI) were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier 
analyses and Cox models. Subgroup analyses were performed by tumor receptor 
subtypes (hormone receptor [HR]+ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
[HER2]-, HER2 +, and triple-negative breast cancer [TNBC]) and residual cancer 
burden (RCB) class.
RESULTS: Among 1877 patients, 526 (28.0%) underwent surgery between 1-4 weeks, 
425 (22.6%) at 5 weeks, 490 (26.1%) between 6-8 weeks, and 436 (23.2%) at 9+ 
weeks post-NAC. Prolonged TTS was associated with worse 5-year EFS and LRFI on 
Kaplan-Meier analysis (p < 0.001 for both). Delays particularly affected 
outcomes in patients with HR+/HER2- and TNBC tumors. In patients with RCB class 
II/III, a TTS of 9+ weeks was independently associated with worse EFS (hazard 
ratio [HR] 2.04, p = 0.001) and LRFI (HR 2.77, p = 0.005). Conversely, in 
patients with a pathologic complete response/RCB class I, delayed surgery did 
not significantly impact outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: TTS of 9+ weeks following NAC is independently associated with 
worse oncologic outcomes, especially in patients with TNBC and HR+/HER2- tumors 
and high residual disease.

BACKGROUND: Approximately one-third of patients with suspected non-ST-elevation 
myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) have non-obstructive coronary artery disease. 
Low-risk patients might benefit from early non-invasive diagnostic testing that 
can appropriately select those without obstructive coronary artery disease and 
prevent unnecessary invasive coronary angiography (ICA). The purpose of this 
study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography angiography 
(CTA) in suspected NSTEMI.
METHODS: Patients with clinically suspected type 1 NSTEMI were included. In case 
ICA was indicated, CTA was performed prior to ICA. The accuracy of CTA to 
diagnose NSTEMI, assigned by an adjudicated final diagnosis committee, was 
investigated.
RESULTS: Of the 66 included patients, 40 (61%) were diagnosed with NSTEMI. 
CAD-RADS ≥ 3 (i.e. stenosis ≥50%) had a sensitivity of 95% (95%CI 83-99%), a 
specificity of 65% (95%CI 44-83%) and an overall accuracy of 83% (95%CI 72-91%). 
The Agatston score was significantly different between patients with and without 
NSTEMI (404 [IQR 132-883] and 31 [IQR 0-163], respectively, p < 0.001). Nineteen 
patients (29%) met the criteria of ≥2 high-risk plaque (HRP) features, which was 
more often present in patients with NSTEMI compared to those without NSTEMI (43% 
and 8%, respectively, p = 0.002). Combining all CTA parameters (CAD-RADS ≥ 3, 
Agatston score >1.000 and ≥2 HRP features) did not improve the diagnostic 
accuracy compared with CAD-RADS alone.
CONCLUSION: CTA accurately diagnoses NSTEMI in patients with acute chest pain 
and elevated high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T levels. Patients with NSTEMI 
more often presented with CAD-RADS ≥ 3, Agatston score >1.000 and HRP features.

Studies assessing genetic associations with neuropathological features in Lewy 
body disease (LBD) have been limited to candidate gene investigations, and 
therefore, information is lacking regarding the genetic architecture of the 
neuropathology of LBD. In the current study, we examined a large series of 
neuropathologically confirmed LBD cases (n = 980 in the discovery series, n = 
503 in the replication series) and performed genome-wide association studies of 
11 different neuropathological outcome measures. The 11 neuropathological 
outcomes included Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stage, Thal amyloid phase, 
LBD subtype, Lewy body (LB) counts in five different brain regions, dorsolateral 
and ventromedial putaminal tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and neuronal 
loss in the ventrolateral part of the substantia nigra. Associations between 
variants and outcomes were assessed using regression models appropriate for the 
nature of the given neuropathological outcome and that were adjusted for age at 
death, sex and top principal components of genetic data. In the discovery 
series, APOE rs429358 (i.e. APOE ε4) was associated with a greater severity of 
each of Braak NFT stage [odds ratio (OR) = 3.07, P = 2.34 × 10-32], Thal amyloid 
phase (OR = 3.57, P = 3.28 × 10-29) and LBD subtype (OR = 1.78, P = 9.85 × 
10-9), with similar findings observed in the independent replication series 
(Braak NFT stage, OR = 2.30, P = 2.70 × 10-11; Thal amyloid phase, OR = 3.17, P 
= 6.39 × 10-18; LBD subtype, OR = 2.68, P = 3.85 × 10-10). In the subgroup of 
cases with lower levels of Alzheimer's disease pathology (Braak NFT stage ≤ III 
and Thal amyloid phase ≤2), there was a strong association between APOE rs429358 
and LBD subtype even when adjusting for Braak stage and Thal phase in the 
discovery series (n = 218, OR = 2.47, P = 0.007) and the replication series (n = 
141, OR = 3.60, P = 0.006). Although additional genome-wide significant 
associations were identified in the discovery series between LINC01581/MCTP2 
rs547411734 and lower middle frontal LB counts, between TLE3 rs3743309 and lower 
cingulate LB counts, and between GRIN2A/ATF7IP2 rs1097915 and lower 
parahippocampal LB counts, these findings were not observed in the replication 
series. Our results indicate that the APOE ε4 allele is the most prominent 
genetic determinant of severity of neuropathology in LBD. These findings 
represent a key step forward in our understanding of genetic drivers of 
neuropathological features in LBD. Future studies utilizing meta-analytical 
approaches will be important to more precisely assess other associations that 
were not quite genome-wide significant in the discovery series.

BACKGROUND: Effective recruitment is crucial for clinical research, yet 
traditional methods can be costly and time-consuming. Digital platforms offer a 
promising opportunity for reaching broader populations. This paper aims to 
provide a descriptive analysis of digital and traditional recruitment strategies 
used to engage women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) and identify 
the most effective methods.
METHODS: From January 2023 to November 2024, women aged 18-40 were recruited 
through traditional methods (flyers, referrals, word-of-mouth, health fairs) and 
digital platforms (Instagram, X, Facebook, Reddit, podcasts, electronic boards, 
clinical trial websites, data exploration tool). Respondents were categorized 
into "All", "Consented," and "Completed," then stratified by generation and 
geographic location. Enrollment and completion rates were calculated.
RESULTS: Among 220 respondents (mean age 28.0 ± 5.9 years), 74 (34 %) consented, 
and 47 (21 %) completed participation. Of all responses, Instagram provided the 
highest recruitment (37 %, n = 82), but had the lowest enrollment rate (17 %). 
Podcasts and word-of-mouth were also effective, with physician referrals 
yielding the highest enrollment (80 %) and completion (100 %) rates yet 
representing one of the lowest recruitment counts (n = 5). While digital 
strategies had three times more outreach, enrollment and completion rates 
remained similar to those of traditional methods. Millennials (n = 117) relied 
more on Facebook and Podcasts, while Gen Z (n = 102) engaged more via electronic 
boards and Reddit.
CONCLUSIONS: Digital platforms, particularly social media and podcasts showed 
significant potential to enhance recruitment efficiency and outreach. However, 
varying completion rates across methods underscore the importance of a 
multifaceted approach to ensure participant diversity and study 
generalizability.

Tumor cells develop various strategies to evade immune surveillance, one of 
which involves altering the metabolic state of the tumor microenvironment. In 
response to metabolic stress in the tumor microenvironment, several 
tumor-infiltrating immune subsets upregulate CD36 to take up lipids. This leads 
to impaired antitumor immunity, as intratumoral regulatory T cells exhibit 
increased survival and suppressive activity, whereas CD8+ T cells become more 
susceptible to ferroptosis and exhaustion. In this study, we develop a humanized 
anti-CD36 IgG4 antibody, PLT012, against the lipid-binding domain of CD36 with 
excellent safety and favorable pharmacokinetic features in mice and cynomolgus 
monkeys. PLT012 alone or in combination with PD-L1 blockade or standard-of-care 
immunotherapy results in robust antitumor immunity in both 
immunotherapy-sensitive and -resistant hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Notably, 
PLT012 also reprograms the immune landscape of human HCC ex vivo. Our findings 
provide proof-of-concept evidence that PLT012 reprograms antitumor immunity in 
HCC, positioning it as a first-in-class immunotherapy targeting CD36.
SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the success of cancer immunotherapies, like immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, many patients still fail to demonstrate significant 
responses because of metabolic constraints in tumors. PLT012 rejuvenates 
antitumor immunity by targeting metabolic pathways to reprogram the immune 
landscape of liver cancer and liver metastasis, with potential to influence 
future HCC immunotherapy.

Sleep disturbance is highly prevalent during pregnancy, and there are no 
guidelines clearly appraising pharmacological treatment for insomnia during 
pregnancy. Furthermore, the data on the efficacy and safety of nonbenzodiazepine 
benzodiazepine receptor agonists in pregnant patients are inconclusive. We 
present a case of insomnia during pregnancy that was managed with doxylamine and 
zolpidem and discuss the current evidence examining the efficacy and potential 
adverse effects of treatment with a focus on the nonbenzodiazepine 
benzodiazepine receptor agonists in the management of insomnia during pregnancy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) 
are increasingly used to treat obesity and diabetes. Semaglutide, a GLP-1RA, is 
linked to nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), macular edema, and 
retinopathy. Because diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (DLRPN) and 
common fibular neuropathy (CFN) are associated with weight loss, we examined 
whether GLP-1RA usage is linked to these neuropathies.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-controlled study from April 28, 2005 
(the first GLP-1RA Food and Drug Administration approval), to December 25, 2024. 
Patients diagnosed with DLRPN or CFN were analyzed for GLP-1RA exposure and 
clinical characteristics. A control group, matched for age, sex, body mass index 
(BMI), and diabetes status, was used to assess for an association with GLP-1RA 
use.
RESULTS: We identified 26 individuals who developed 27 DLRPN episodes, with 
median symptom onset 6 months (range 3-35 months) after GLP-1RA initiation. At 
onset, they had a median glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) reduction of 2.4% 
(range 1%-8.5%) and a BMI decrease of 4 units (range 1-15), reflecting a 13.9% 
(range 3.6%-28.5%) weight loss. Microvasculitis was present in 4 of 5 nerve 
biopsies. Among 77 individuals with CFN, 82 episodes developed, with a mean 
GLP-1RA duration of 15 months (range 1-112 months). In individuals with CFN, the 
median HbA1c reduction was 1.2% (range -0.4% to 5%) and the BMI decrease was 4 
units (range 0-15), corresponding to a 15.7% (range 3.0%-37.0%) weight loss. 
Patients with DLRPN experienced greater HbA1c reductions than patients with CFN 
(2.4% vs 1.2%, p < 0.001). New NAION, macular edema, or retinopathy were not 
seen with episodes. Compared with controls, GLP-1RA users were 51% more likely 
to develop DLRPN (odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-1.9, p = 0.0008) and 30% more 
likely to develop CFN (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.5, p = 0.018). All episodes occurred 
after 2015, with 3 DLRPN events and 7 CFN events occurring between 2015 and 
2019, rising to 24 and 70 cases in 2020-2024, reflecting increases of 700% and 
900%.
DISCUSSION: GLP-1RA use is associated with an increased likelihood of DLRPN and 
CFN. DLRPN and its associated nerve microvasculitis seem more strongly linked to 
metabolic changes, particularly significant HbA1c reductions, while CFN has 
compressive neuropathy characteristics and is more influenced by weight loss.

Scleral lenses have been shown to provide improved visual acuity and ocular 
surface protection in patients with corneal irregularities and ocular surface 
disease. However, scleral lens (SL) wear may lead to anterior ocular pathology 
owing to metabolic or mechanical stress. Most reports of SL-related 
complications have described microbial keratitis or hypoxia-related issues. 
There is limited literature describing complications caused by mechanical 
interactions, such as suction between the SL and ocular surface. This case 
report describes a patient with long-standing keratoconjunctivitis and 
keratoconus who developed intracorneal hemorrhage within 4 hr of completing 
application and removal training on the first day of SL wear.

BACKGROUND: The radiolunate joint is conventionally thought to be spared from 
radiocarpal osteoarthritis, but proximal lunate degenerative changes have been 
noted. An investigation of radiolunate arthrokinematics in ostensibly healthy 
wrists may improve understanding of posttraumatic and postoperative outcomes. We 
hypothesize that four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT)-derived radiolunate 
arthrokinematics during motion will differ between wrists with type 1 and type 2 
lunates. The clinical-translational relevance of this analysis is highlighted 
using a 4DCT case study of scaphoid excision with 4-corner arthrodesis (SEFCA).
METHODS: Four-dimensional computed tomography data were collected during 
flexion-extension and radioulnar deviation in 19 healthy wrists (mean [SD] age: 
43.6 [11.7] years, 21.1% female) and 1 wrist 3 years after SEFCA (male, 52 
years). Carpal osteokinematics and joint arthrokinematics were calculated to 
derive median radiolunate interosseous proximities at each 4DCT-captured 
timepoint.
RESULTS: Median radiolunate interosseous proximities during motion are well 
approximated by second-order regressions in uninjured wrists. In the arthrodesed 
wrist, closest proximities occurred at the extremes of motion except maximum 
radial deviation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study quantifies a normative range of median radiolunate 
interosseous proximities during wrist motion. The normative 4DCT datasets 
provide a reference range for evaluating postoperative arthrokinematics, 
suggesting the clinical-translational potential of dynamic imaging. The case 
study highlights applications for patient-level postoperative evaluation, which 
can be expanded to other pathologies, surgeries, or conditions in the future.

PURPOSE: To investigate thermal injury risks from either radiofrequency 
(RF)-heating or excessive cooling by high-pressure gas supply lines (HPGSL) 
during MRI-guided cryoablations, and to identify clinically viable safety 
precautions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ex vivo experiments were performed on a 1.5 Tesla MRI 
scanner utilizing an MRI conditional cryoablation system. A cryoneedle was 
inserted into a porcine tissue specimen with an HPGSL routed out of the scanner 
along the tissue surface and either connected to or disconnected from the 
ablation system. Experiments were performed with varied layers of operating room 
(OR) towels or a 2.5 cm thick foam pad between the HPGSL and tissue. Fiber-optic 
sensors were used to measure temperatures on the HPGSL surface, cryoneedle, and 
tissue surface during MRI at different specific absorption rates (SAR) or during 
active freezing.
RESULTS: During MRI, tissue surface temperatures nearest the HPGSL increased by 
up to 40.7 ± 6.9 °C. Tissue temperature increases were reduced to less than 
0.1°C as thicker insulation with OR towels or the foam pad were added between 
the HPGSL and tissue. Disconnecting the HPGSL reduced tissue heating near the 
HPGSL by 47 %. Tissue heating decreased linearly with decreased SAR. During 
freezing, the HPGSL cooled to 53.3 ± 1.2 °C below room temperature of 20.9°C. 
With the foam pad added, the tissue surface cooled to 1.2 ± 0.2 °C below room 
temperature.
CONCLUSION: During MRI-guided cryoablations the HPGSL poses significant patient 
risks of RF-burns or frostbite, which can be mitigated by ensuring adequate 
distance between the HPGSL and tissue using insulating materials.

Cutaneous adverse events (cAEs) are among the most common toxicities associated 
with modern cancer therapies, which are particularly heightened among 
immunotherapies and targeted agents. Despite being frequently immune-mediated, 
the majority of cAEs are mild to moderate and can be effectively managed without 
interruption of anticancer treatment. In immunotherapies-receiving patients, 
common phenotypes of cAEs include eczema-like, lichenoid, psoriasiform, 
vitiligo-like, and bullous eruptions. Targeted therapies including epidermal 
growth factor receptor inhibitors, BRAF inhibitors/MEK inhibitors, and 
phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors are frequently associated with 
papulopustular eruptions, xerosis, paronychia, and photosensitivity. 
Mechanistically, cAEs may result from on-target immune activation, which 
correlates with treatment efficacy, or off-target hypersensitivity. Notably, 
certain phenotypes such as vitiligo, alopecia areata, and lichenoid reactions 
have been associated with improved survival in melanoma and non-small cell lung 
cancer. Management is guided based on the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events grading, emphasizing the role of topical therapies for mild 
cases, systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants for moderate-to-severe 
reactions, and biologic or novel topical agents for steroid-refractory disease. 
By timely and appropriate intervention, most cAEs are manageable and may carry 
favorable prognostic significance. Early dermatologic collaboration is essential 
to reduce morbidity and ensure uninterrupted oncologic therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) is approved for relapsed or 
refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). In the CARTITUDE-4 study (NCT04181827), 
cilta-cel demonstrated superior efficacy versus pomalidomide, bortezomib, and 
dexamethasone or daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone in patients with 
RRMM after 1-3 prior lines of therapy (LOT). We conducted an indirect treatment 
comparison to understand the comparative efficacy of cilta-cel versus real-world 
(RW) physician's choice of treatment for lenalidomide-refractory MM.
METHODS: De-identified data from the Flatiron Health MM cohort registry (January 
2020 to May 2024) were compared with data from CARTITUDE-4 (data cutoff May 1, 
2024). Key eligibility criteria for CARTITUDE-4 were used to match patients from 
the Flatiron database. Baseline covariates of prognostic significance were 
adjusted using inverse probability of treatment weighting. Outcomes for 
comparative effectiveness included progression-free survival (PFS), RW PFS, time 
to next treatment (TTNT), and overall survival (OS). Sensitivity analyses were 
conducted.
RESULTS: The CARTITUDE-4 cohort included data from 208 patients who received 
cilta-cel; the median follow-up was 33.6 months. The real-world cohort included 
932 patients (1445 eligible LOT) from the Flatiron database; the median 
follow-up was 23.6 months. In base case analyses, compared with the Flatiron 
cohort, patients treated with cilta-cel had improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.29 
[95% confidence interval (CI)] 0.22-0.36; p < 0.001), RW-PFS (HR 0.29 [95% CI 
0.23-0.37]; p < 0.001), TTNT (HR 0.32 [95% CI 0.25-0.41]; p < 0.001), and OS (HR 
0.59 [95% CI 0.41-0.84]; p = 0.003). These findings were consistent across all 
sensitivity analyses.
CONCLUSION: Cilta-cel lengthened TTNT and demonstrated meaningful prolongation 
in PFS and OS compared with real-world physician's choice for 
lenalidomide-refractory MM. These data highlight the value of cilta-cel as an 
effective therapy in earlier-line patients with relapsed, 
lenalidomide-refractory MM exposed to proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory 
drugs.

MN, United States.

Thyroid eye disease (TED) is a complex ocular autoimmune disorder primarily 
associated with Graves' disease. It leads to significant morbidity due to 
orbital inflammation, fibrosis, and tissue expansion. While corticosteroids have 
been the traditional mainstay of therapy, recent advancements in understanding 
TED pathophysiology have driven the development of targeted treatments. Notably, 
inhibition of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor with teprotumumab has 
revolutionized TED management, demonstrating efficacy in reducing proptosis and 
disease severity. Additional emerging therapies, including neonatal Fc receptor 
inhibitors, thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor blockers, and interleukin-6 
receptor antagonists, offer promising alternatives for patients with active and 
refractory disease. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in disease 
classification and outcome assessment. As the landscape of TED management 
continues to evolve, this review provides a comprehensive overview of current 
and emerging therapies for TED, critically examines gaps in disease evaluation, 
and highlights the evolving paradigm of patient-centered care. Future efforts 
should focus on optimizing therapeutic algorithms, refining risk stratification 
models, guiding personalized treatment, and promoting a multidisciplinary 
approach, which remain essential in improving outcomes and quality of life for 
affected individuals.

BACKGROUND: Mentorship is crucial for developing both scientific and 
professional competencies in medical training, yet its role in endocrinology 
training remains underexplored. We aimed to assess the prevalence of mentorship 
in endocrinology trainees, analyse demographic and training programme factors, 
and evaluate the impact of mentor characteristics on trainee outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of endocrinology trainees in the 
United States and Europe (23 countries) between June 2023 to January 2024. 
Participants were recruited via professional societies, email lists, and social 
media. Those who had completed more than 7 years of training post-medical school 
or had missing data on duration of training were excluded. A structured online 
questionnaire was developed using validated mentorship competency tools and 
adapted for regional nuances to collect data on demographics, mentorship 
experiences, academic productivity, and well-being. The primary outcome assessed 
the prevalence of mentorship; secondary outcomes evaluated the associations 
between mentor characteristics and self-reported academic productivity, 
satisfaction within the mentorship relationship, and levels of burnout and 
stress. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were 
conducted.
FINDINGS: Between June 10, 2023, and January 1, 2024, 250 respondents (154 from 
the U.S. and 96 from Europe; 70.0% women, 64.4% White), 75.8% reported having a 
mentor. Significant regional differences emerged: U.S. trainees predominantly 
self-selected their mentors (69.7% vs. 23.1% in Europe) and reported less 
frequent interactions (monthly or less vs. more than weekly in Europe). 
Univariable analyses revealed that attributes such as active listening, 
inspirational guidance, and personalised career support were strongly linked to 
enhanced academic productivity, higher training satisfaction, and reduced 
burnout. In multivariable models, inspirational guidance was a significant 
predictor of academic productivity among U.S. trainees (94.4% vs. 35.3%, OR: 
54.72, 95% CI: 4.7-2255.9), while in Europe, mentors facilitating strategic 
goal-meeting was associated with decreased burnout (77.8% vs. 40.0%, OR: 5.49, 
95% CI: 1.1-33.7) and inspirational guidance with markedly improved mentorship 
satisfaction (90.7% vs. 28.6%, OR: 51.86, 95% CI: 2.2-1177.2).
INTERPRETATION: Though the design precludes causal inference, these findings 
underscore the universal benefits of mentorship in endocrinology training and 
highlight that targeted mentor competencies are key drivers of trainee success. 
Tailoring mentorship frameworks to regional training contexts may optimise 
academic productivity, training satisfaction, and overall well-being. Future 
longitudinal and qualitative studies are needed to clarify causal pathways and 
evaluate the effectiveness of tailored mentorship interventions.

BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) end-systolic enlargement in severe 
degenerative mitral-regurgitation (MR) is a class I surgical trigger. Whether it 
occurs disproportionately to less-than-severe MR due to mitral valve prolapse 
and is associated with mortality are unknown. We aimed to analyze prevalence and 
association with survival of disproportionate LV enlargement in less-than-severe 
MR.
METHODS: A multicenter cohort international study enrolled 2848 consecutive 
patients (52% women, 69±16 years) with degenerative MR prospectively quantified 
and graded mild or moderate. Primary end point was survival under medical 
management. Secondary outcome was survival throughout follow-up stratified by 
performance of early mitral surgery within 3 months postdiagnosis.
RESULTS: Among LV remodeling parameters (abnormal end-diastolic diameter, LV 
end-systolic diameter [LVESD] absolute and indexed), LVESD ≥40 mm (present in 
12.4%) was the sole independent associate of reduced survival (5-year 70±3 
versus 76±9%; P=0.009). LVESD ≥40 mm was independently linked to larger body 
surface area, effective regurgitant orifice, and left atrium, and to male sex 
and diabetes. With multivariable comprehensive adjustment, LVESD ≥40 mm 
(adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.25 [95% CI, 1.005-1.53]; P=0.04) remained 
associated with excess mortality under medical management, even after adjustment 
for lowered ejection fraction (aHR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.13-1.95]; P=0.004) and in 
all patient subsets. Among patients with moderate degenerative MR and LVESD 
≥40 mm, 22% underwent mitral surgery within 3 months, which was associated with 
superior survival, even after comprehensive adjustment (aHR, 0.11 [95% CI, 
0.005-0.51]; P=0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: Disproportionate LV enlargement in patients with less-than-severe 
degenerative MR is common, particularly with larger bodies, regurgitation, and 
overall cardiac remodeling. LVESD ≥40 mm is associated with worse survival 
independent of all baseline characteristics, even lowered ejection fraction, and 
represents a marker for risk stratification of patients who are generally not 
yet considered for medical or surgical/interventional treatment.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), symptoms of posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with aberrations in brain networks 
in the absence of a given cognitive demand or task, called resting-state 
networks. Prior work has focused on disruption in the static functional 
connectivity (FC) among specific regions constrained by a priori hypotheses. 
However, dynamic FC, an approach that examines brain network characteristics 
over time, may provide a more sensitive measure to understand the network 
properties underlying dysfunction in PTSD. Further, using a data-driven analytic 
approach may reveal the contribution of other larger network disturbances beyond 
those revealed by hypothesis-driven examinations of ROIs or canonical networks. 
Therefore, the current study used group independent components analysis (ICA) 
and graph theory principles to identify, characterize, and subsequently compare 
brain network dynamics and recurrent connectivity states in a large sample of 
trauma exposed individuals (N = 1035) with and without PTSD from the ENIGMA-PGC 
PTSD workgroup. Neither static FC nor dynamic FC results showed robust 
differences between groups. There were also no group differences in dwell time 
or number of transitions of recurrent connectivity states. This multi-cohort 
sample with heterogenous trauma types and demographic features offers a 
significantly larger scale approach than prior literature with smaller 
homogenous trauma cohorts. Heterogeneity of PTSD, especially within diffuse 
brain networks, may not be captured by evaluating only diagnostic groups, 
further work should be done to evaluate brain network dynamics with respect to 
specific symptom profiles and trauma types.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) is the most effective and 
durable approach to treating obesity, yet recurrent weight gain occurs in a 
subset of patients. Primary care often serves as a routine point of contact for 
patients following MBS and is a potential gateway for addressing and/or 
preventing recurrent weight gain.
METHODS: Although guidelines for the management of recurrent weight gain after 
MBS exist, this narrative review was undertaken to clarify the role of the 
primary care providers in enhancing long-term outcomes and preventing weight 
gain after MBS.
FINDINGS: Regular follow-up in primary care provides an opportunity to identify 
challenges related to weight management and overall health outcomes, which may 
include concerns related to nutrition, mental or physical well-being, body 
image, motivation, and behavior change, for example. The availability of 
multidisciplinary providers within primary care settings, including behavioral 
health specialists, dietitians, and physical therapists, is an important 
strength of this setting in addressing potential post-MBS concerns such as 
recurrent weight gain.
CONCLUSION: This review outlines clinical considerations for managing recurrent 
weight gain post-MBS in primary care and includes recommendations for both 
primary care providers and specialty clinicians working in primary care to 
deliver care effectively and mitigate weight stigma post-MBS.

BackgroundSex-based differences may influence the clinical management, 
complication risks, and healthcare resource utilization of hospitalized 
end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). 
Understanding these disparities is essential for optimizing patient care and 
informing healthcare policy.MethodsThis study was conducted using the National 
Inpatient Sample to identify hospitalized adult ESKD patients receiving PD from 
the year 2003 to 2018. The outcomes included 1) PD-related outcomes, defined as 
a composite of peritonitis, mechanical complications, catheter removal or 
revision, and adequacy issues, 2) non-PD-related outcomes, defined as a 
composite of sepsis, cardiac arrest, and need for mechanical ventilation 3) 
transfer to hemodialysis, and 4) in-hospital mortality. The associations between 
sex and in-hospital outcomes were analyzed using multivariable logistic 
regression and were adjusted for demographic factors, comorbidities, primary 
diagnoses, admission types, and hospital characteristics. Discharge weights were 
applied to generate nationally representative estimates.ResultsOf 97,036 
hospitalized ESKD patients receiving PD analyzed, 48,906 (50.4%) were females. 
In adjusted analyses, there were no overall sex differences in PD-related 
outcomes, non-PD-related outcomes, or in-hospital mortality. However, age- and 
comorbidity-based variations were observed in PD-related outcomes. Female sex 
was associated with lower odds of transfer to hemodialysis, particularly among 
younger patients and those without heart failure or peripheral vascular disease. 
Notably, sex differences in in-hospital mortality were observed only among 
patients with elective admissions.ConclusionThere were sex-based disparities in 
the outcomes and healthcare utilization of hospitalized ESKD patients receiving 
PD. These findings underscore the need for sex-specific, individualized 
strategies to improve PD care and inform clinical and policy decisions.

Opinions Regarding Dual-Implant Fixation and Weight-Bearing in Distal Femur 
Fractures: A Survey From the 2022 Orthopaedic Trauma Association Traveling 
Fellowship.

(1)From the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 
(Thompson, Khanna, and Yuan), Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Hennepin County 
Medical Center, Minneapolis, M.N. (Wagstrom), and Department of Orthopedic 
Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA (Little).

INTRODUCTION: To describe current opinions of staff orthopaedic trauma surgeons 
on the surgical treatment of distal femur fractures, with attention to 
indications for dual-implant constructs, application techniques, and 
postoperative rehabilitation.
METHODS: A 22-question survey was given to fellowship-trained orthopaedic trauma 
surgeons at institutions visited by the 2022 Orthopaedic Trauma Association 
Fellows to characterize opinions on techniques, indications, and postoperative 
weight-bearing status for five example distal femur fractures. Demographic data 
were collected. Participants responses on implants and weight-bearing were 
recorded. Opinions on technique of dual-implant fixation were collected.
RESULTS: The survey was returned by 57 surgeons. Most respondents preferred a 
single implant (retrograde intramedullary nails or lateral locked plate) and 
weight-bearing as tolerated for the extra-articular and periprosthetic fracture. 
The preference for dual-implant fixation increased with metaphyseal bone loss 
(46%) and for nonunion treatment (53%). Articular involvement had the strongest 
effect on weight-bearing (17% weight-bearing as tolerated with simple articular 
split, 6% with articular comminution). Respondents preferred a retrograde 
intramedullary nails plus lateral locked plate over dual-plate fixation. 
Rationale for dual-implant fixation were early mobilization (32%), poor distal 
fixation (32%), and absent medial column support (30%).
DISCUSSION: This survey of current practice among institutions participating in 
the 2022 Orthopaedic Trauma Association Traveling Fellowship demonstrates that 
common fracture-related indications for dual-implant fixation include nonunion 
treatment and comminuted fractures with bone loss. The ability for earlier 
mobilization, poor fixation, and lack of medial column support were the most 
common indications for dual-implant fixation. This survey highlights the need 
for further studies investigating best treatment for distal femur fractures and 
sets the stage for future studies of dual-implant constructs.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V, descriptive survey study.

Evening binge alcohol consumption contributes to sleep disruption and autonomic 
dysregulation that persists into the following morning. However, its impact on 
morning after arterial stiffness and aortic wave reflection remains unknown. 
Using a randomized, crossover, and fluid-controlled design, we hypothesized that 
heart rate (HR), carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV), aortic 
augmentation index (AIx), and aortic pulsatile load (APL) would be increased 
acutely after binge drinking at night (Study 1) and the morning-after binge 
drinking (Study 2). Participants [n = 33; 18 females, 15 males; aged 25 ± 1 yr; 
body mass index (BMI): 27 ± 1 kg/m2] completed binge alcohol (equivalent to 4-5 
drinks) and fluid control protocols. Study 1 examined cardiovascular responses 
during resting baseline and within 30 min of evening alcohol consumption, 
whereas Study 2 examined cardiovascular responses within 15 min of waking the 
morning-after binge alcohol or fluid control. In Study 1, HR and APL increased 
after the final dose of alcohol (P < 0.001) but decreased with fluid control. In 
Study 2, morning HR (63 ± 2 vs. 57 ± 1 beats/min; P < 0.001), APL (2,060 ± 82 
vs. 1,857 ± 66 a.u.; P = 0.012), and AIx normalized to 75 beats/min (AIx@75) 
(6.5 ± 2.4 vs. 2.9 ± 2.5%; P = 0.042) were increased, whereas unadjusted AIx was 
unchanged, after binge alcohol compared with fluid control. cfPWV was not 
altered by binge alcohol acutely (Study 1) or the morning after (Study 2). Our 
results indicate evening binge alcohol consumption elicited acute increases in 
HR and APL, and morning-after increases in HR, APL, and AIx@75. These findings 
highlight physiological mechanisms that might contribute to well-documented 
associations between binge alcohol consumption and heightened cardiovascular 
risk.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Increases in aortic wave reflection and aortic pulsatile 
load are known contributors to hypertension, cardiovascular risk, and pulsatile 
stress to end organs. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate 
that evening binge alcohol consumption increases heart rate, aortic pulsatile 
load, and aortic augmentation index the following morning when compared with 
fluid control. These findings highlight the deleterious overnight cardiovascular 
effects of binge alcohol consumption in young adults.

IMPORTANCE: The Ophthalmic Knowledge Assessment Program (OKAP) has been widely 
used to determine readiness to take the high-stakes Written Qualifying 
Examination (WQE). However, it is unclear how well OKAP performance can predict 
WQE outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the OKAP and WQE nationally.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a retrospective cohort study 
conducted from 2017 to 2022. This national data analysis included residents from 
ophthalmology residency programs in the US. Study data were analyzed June 2023 
to December 2024.
EXPOSURES: OKAP and WQE data.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The national OKAP examination data and the WQE data 
were matched. Candidates who had complete data for the OKAP during postgraduate 
year (PGY) 2, 3, and 4 and completed the WQE were included in the study. 
Two-sample t tests, logistic regression analysis, receiver operating 
characteristic curves, and confusion matrix were used to examine the association 
of various test scores (PGY-2 OKAP, PGY-3 OKAP, PGY-4 OKAP, minimum OKAP, 
maximum OKAP, average OKAP) as predictors for WQE outcomes (pass or fail). 
Multiple logistic regression analyses were also used to assess the association 
of gender, time since graduation, program size, and WQE pass/fail outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 1597 residents (907 male [56.8%]) from 117 residency 
programs were included in this study. First-time pass rate of the WQE was 89% 
(1418 of 1597 residents). OKAP scores, particularly average OKAP, maximum OKAP, 
and PGY-4 OKAP scores (all had area under the curve = 0.88), were the most 
useful predictor of WQE outcomes. PGY-4 OKAP scores were used for the rest of 
the analysis for simplicity. A PGY-4 OKAP scaled score of 550 corresponded to 
94% of candidates passing the WQE. Using PGY-4 OKAP scores to predict 
passing/failing, the WQE had 90.7% accuracy. Gender (odds ratio [OR], 1.50; 95% 
CI, 1.01-2.26; P = .048), program size (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 0.98-2.41; P = .06), 
and time since residency graduation (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.00; P = .14) were 
not included in the logistic regression model investigating the association of 
PGY-4 OKAP scores with the likelihood of passing the WQE.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results suggest that OKAP examination scores were 
associated with passing the WQE after adjusting for program size, gender, and 
time since residency graduation. Further analyses may be warranted to predict 
failing the WQE so that potential interventions can be attempted.

BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a draft guidance 
document detailing core patient-reported outcomes in cancer clinical trials, 
including physical function (PF). The objectives of this study were to develop 
analytic methods and visualizations of patient-reported PF in patients with 
cancer.
METHODS: We applied an estimand framework to a patient-reported tolerability 
endpoint to develop data summaries cross-sectionally and over time, along with 
visualizations. We accomplished this through iterative feedback with clinicians, 
statisticians, and FDA stakeholders using three clinical trial datasets in 
hematologic malignancies. Graphical approaches were applied to three datasets in 
hematologic malignancies: (1) patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms 
enrolled in MPN-RC 111/112 trials completed EORTC QLQ-C30 over 12 months; (2) 
patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing CAR-T cell therapy or 
autologous transplant who completed FACT questionnaires over 6 months; and (3) 
patients with multiple myeloma or amyloidosis who completed the PROMIS-29 
questionnaire over 6 months. Zoom polls were administered to two stakeholder 
groups (clinicians/clinical investigators and patient advocates) to elicit 
feedback.
RESULTS: Visualizations included stacked bar charts, line plots of arithmetic 
mean changes from baseline, pie charts, waffle plots, and waterfall plots of PF 
data. Graphics considered scaled scores and individual items and included 
delineation of PRO completion rate at each time point. Confidence intervals and 
reference lines were included as applicable, and colorblind accessible colors 
were implemented to ensure inclusivity of all visualizations. Data summaries 
over time reporting "worst" change were difficult to interpret. In terms of 
stakeholders' preference, patients preferred stacked bar charts while clinicians 
equally favored stacked bar charts and line plots; both patients and clinicians 
preferred waterfall plots to pie charts. Patient feedback highlighted the need 
for various graphics to convey group level trends and granular 
individual-patient level information.
CONCLUSION: Patient-reported PF informs the evaluation of treatment tolerability 
in cancer trials. Data summaries and visualizations of physical function 
developed through an iterative process were reviewed favorably by patients, 
clinicians and FDA stakeholders in this study. Future work to systematically 
assess accuracy of interpretation of the various analytic and visualization 
methods is a necessary next step across clinical, regulatory, payer and patient 
stakeholders.

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) have long been used in laboratory 
facilities and recently revolutionized the field of molecular diagnostics in 
point-of-care testing. Digital microfluidics (DMF) has emerged as a promising 
tool to complete the entire NAAT workflow in a miniaturized format with minimum 
human intervention. Based on electric fields to manipulate independent reaction 
droplets, the compact DMF system could perform multiple processes simultaneously 
and automatically in a programmable fashion. This combination is beginning to 
establish powerful sample-to-answer platforms in remote or resource-limited 
settings. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art 
DMF technology for point-of-care NAAT. This review focused on key principles of 
DMF platforms and the latest trends in system integration for automated 
processes of nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection. Also, this 
article discusses current challenges, including control systems, scalability and 
throughput, as well as future prospects of DMF-based NAAT strategy for the next 
generation of point-of-care diagnostics.

Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD) is a clonal-inflammatory neoplasm driven by 
mutations in MAPK pathway proto-oncogenes, such as BRAF. Clinical manifestations 
are protean, affecting virtually every system. This cohort study analyzed 661 
patients with ECD to classify them based on clinical features and mutational 
profiles using unsupervised clustering. Nineteen clinical and mutational 
variables were subjected to hierarchical clustering combined with k-means. A 
three-cluster model emerged as the most stable. Most patients were classified 
according to key features, namely BRAFV600E mutation, and large-vessel, heart, 
and perirenal involvement. The "Widespread Disease" (WID) cluster (320 patients, 
49%) was associated with the presence of the key features and the "Limited 
Disease" (LIM) cluster (282 patients, 42%) was associated with their absence. 
The "MAP2K1-RDD" cluster (MAP) was assigned 59 patients (9%), based on MAP2K1 
mutation and/or overlapping Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes disease (RDD). Survival 
analysis revealed worse outcomes for WID compared to LIM (hazard ratio 1.54, 95% 
CI 1.09-2.17), while no significant survival difference was found for MAP. The 
identification of these clusters, based on mutational profiles, organ 
involvement and overlapping conditions, offers a data-driven validation of 
established clinical observations. These findings substantiate the role of the 
somatic mutation type in shaping the ECD phenotype.

INTRODUCTION: Rituximab, an anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)-20 monoclonal 
antibody, is used in the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, and rheumatoid arthritis. The pharmacokinetics of 
rituximab have been reported to be target mediated, but this alone may not fully 
explain the nonlinear decay of its concentrations over time.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the potential role of immunoglobulin (Fc 
gamma receptor; FcγR) and neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in the disposition of 
rituximab.
METHODS: Concentration-time data from 108 patients with NHL, 118 with chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia, and 90 with rheumatoid arthritis were collected to refine 
a two-compartment population pharmacokinetic model with target-mediated drug 
disposition and irreversible binding approximation. Non-specific rituximab 
elimination was described using an intercompartment FcRn-mediated disposition 
model. Additionally, rituximab was assumed to bind to FcγR-expressing cells in 
both central and peripheral compartments; its disposition resulting from these 
mechanisms was described using quasi-steady-state interaction models.
RESULTS: The FcRn-mediated disposition model provided a satisfactory description 
of the data and was further improved by incorporating central and peripheral 
FcγR quasi-steady-state interaction models with steady-state dissociation 
constants estimated at 586 and 418 nM, respectively. CD19 cell count was related 
to target-mediated elimination rate constant (p = 1.7 × 10-8) and inversely 
related to non-specific elimination (assessed by estimated FcRn amount, p = 2.1 
× 10-8). In patients with NHL, FcγR levels in central and peripheral 
compartments increased with baseline metabolic tumor volume (p = 7.0 × 10-6 and 
p = 5.0 × 10-28, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of rituximab are mediated both by Fab (target) 
interactions and by FcγR and FcRn interactions.

BACKGROUND: There is renewed interest in debridement, antibiotics, and implant 
retention (DAIR) for acute periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs). The purpose 
of this study was to assess the results of single DAIRs for acute PJI after 
primary hip arthroplasty in a large series with extended follow-up.
METHODS: We identified 126 hips (108 total hip arthroplasties, 18 
hemiarthroplasties) with acute PJIs treated with DAIR followed by chronic 
antibiotic suppression between 2000 and 2021 at a single institution. Acute 
postoperative PJI was defined as infection within four weeks of primary hip 
arthroplasty, and acute hematogenous PJI was defined as infection occurring more 
than four weeks after primary hip arthroplasty with symptoms for less than 21 
days. The mean age was 67 years, 44% were women, and the mean body mass index 
was 34. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analyses were performed. The mean follow-up 
was seven years.
RESULTS: Survivorship free of reinfection was 80% at one year, 79% at two years, 
and 77% at five years. There was no difference in survivorship free of 
reinfection between early postoperative and acute hematogenous PJIs (P = 0.1). 
McPherson Host Grade C was predictive of reinfection (hazard ratio 5, P = 0.03). 
Reinfection was caused by the original organism in 33% of hips. The median time 
to reinfection was 13 days. Survivorship free of any revision was 82% at five 
years. Indications for revision included recurrent PJI (91%), dislocation (5%), 
and aseptic failures (5%).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large series of acute PJIs after primary hip arthroplasties 
treated with a single DAIR, infection-free survival was 77% at five years. Poor 
host status predicted reinfection. With a rigorous definition of acute PJI, 
success was markedly improved at extended follow-up compared to many historical 
series.

We sought to develop a survival model in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) 
that is primarily based on clinical variables and examine additional impact from 
mutations and karyotype. A total of 457 molecularly annotated patients were 
considered. Multivariable analysis identified circulating blasts ≥2% (1 point), 
leukocytes ≥13 × 109/L (1 point), and severe (2 points) or moderate (1 point) 
anemia as preferred risk variables in developing a clinical risk stratification 
tool for overall survival (OS), acronymized to "BLAST": low risk (0 points; 
median, 63 months); intermediate risk (1 point; median, 28 months; hazard ratio 
[HR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-3.0), and high risk (2-4 points; 
median, 13 months; HR, 5.4; 95% CI, 4.1-7.3); the corresponding 3/5-year OS 
rates were 68%/53%, 43%/18%, and 12%/1%. BLAST model performance (area under the 
receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.77/0.85 at 3/5 years) was shown 
to be comparable to that of the molecular CMML-specific prognostic scoring 
system (AUC 0.73/0.75) and the international prognostic scoring system-molecular 
(AUC 0.73/0.74). Multivariable analysis of mutations and karyotype identified 
PHF6MUT and TET2MUT as being "favorable" and DNMT3AMUT, U2AF1MUT, BCORMUT, 
SETBP1MUT, ASXL1MUT, NRASMUT, PTPN11MUT, RUNX1MUT, TP53MUT, and adverse 
karyotype, "unfavorable." Molecular information was subsequently encoded in a 
combined clinical-molecular risk model (BLAST-mol; AUC 0.80/0.86 at 3/5 years) 
that included the aforementioned BLAST clinical risk variables and a 3-tiered 
molecular risk score. BLAST and BLAST-mol were subsequently validated by 2 
separate external cohorts. Independent risk factors for blast transformation 
included DNMT3AMUT, ASXL1MUT, PHF6WT, leukocytes ≥13 × 109/L, and ≥2% 
circulating or ≥10% bone marrow blasts. The current study proposes an 
easy-to-implement, globally applicable, and molecularly adaptive risk model for 
CMML.

Heat shock protein family B (small) member 8 (HSPB8) promotes chaperone-assisted 
selective autophagy (CASA), which assures proteostasis in muscles and neurons. 
HSPB8 frameshift mutations found in neuromyopathies are translated on the same 
frame, generating the same C-terminal extension, which causes HSPB8 aggregation 
and proteostasis defects. Here, we describe three novel HSPB8 frameshift 
variants, translated to protein using the third alternative frame to stop codons 
downstream to the canonical one and to the one used by other known HSPB8 
frameshift mutants. Therefore, these variants are predicted to encode a 
C-terminal extension that is different in length and amino acids. HSPB8 
c.562delC and c.520_523delTACT were identified in two unrelated sporadic 
patients, while c.515delC, in a familial case of early-onset myopathy. Patients 
may differentially exhibit additional pathological features, such as neuropathy, 
respiratory insufficiency, and, remarkably, severe cardiomyopathy. Skeletal 
muscle biopsies revealed variations in fiber size, atrophy, multiple vacuoles, 
fat infiltration, and eosinophilic inclusions. In a reconstituted cell model of 
disease the expression of one representative novel HSPB8 mutant results in i) 
aggregation of the HSPB8 mutant, ii) sequestration of both the HSPB8 wild-type 
and CASA complex members, as well as iii) the autophagy receptor sequestosome-1 
(SQSTM1/p62), iv) accumulation of ubiquitinated substrates, and v) defects in 
CASA-mediated degradation. Our results prove that the last exon of the HSPB8 
gene is highly susceptible to pathogenic mutations, resulting in a wider 
phenotypic spectrum associated with HSPB8 frameshift variants. Our studies 
suggest the importance of HSPB8 genetic testing not only for neuropathy and 
myopathy but also for cardiomyopathy.

BACKGROUND: The operative standard for melanoma, implemented by the Commission 
on Cancer (CoC), addresses margin width and excision depth, but does not collect 
information on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, SLNB, an implemented 
technical standard in breast cancer, is also critical in the management of 
melanoma through its impact on nodal staging. This study aimed to characterize 
the current facility-level variation in nodal yield and nodal positivity to 
determine if there is an opportunity for improvement through standardization.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database, we identified patients 
with T1b-T4 melanoma of the trunk and upper extremities who underwent SLNB from 
2018 to 2022. Reliability-adjusted estimates for nodal yield and nodal 
positivity were calculated using Poisson regression and logistic regression with 
random intercepts for hospitals.
RESULTS: We identified 48,653 melanoma patients from 1167 facilities. SLNB 
median nodal yield was 2.4 (IQR 2.2-2.7), ranging from 1.4 to 7.0. SLNB median 
nodal positivity was 18.0% (IQR 17.1-19.5%), ranging from 11.6 to 40.5%. A weak 
correlation between nodal yield and nodal positivity was observed (Spearman 
correlation coefficient = 0.08, p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: Facility-level variation in nodal yield was minimal and weakly 
correlated with nodal positivity. This suggests that SLNB performed for melanoma 
of the trunk and upper extremities is well standardized across CoC hospitals in 
the absence of a defined operative standard. Future efforts to improve the 
quality of melanoma nodal surgery may be best focused on technical elements of 
other procedures, such as lymphadenectomy or more novel lymph node dissection 
approaches following neoadjuvant therapy.

BACKGROUND: Neurogeneticists are specialized providers who focus on diagnosing 
and managing genetic disorders affecting the nervous system. Training pathways 
for neurogeneticists vary, including dual residencies in neurology and genetics, 
one-year fellowships, or extensive clinical experience. This diversity reflects 
the expanding applications of neurogenomics across neurology. Our research aims 
to identify strategies used by such subspecialists to help neurologists more 
effectively incorporate genetic testing into practice, improving patient 
outcomes.
METHODS: A survey was conducted among neurogeneticists across the United States 
to assess the practice parameters of neurogenetic clinics, assess program 
development, and highlight the educational requirements needed to manage these 
patient populations. The survey, approved by the Children's National Hospital 
Institutional Review Board, included 25 questions about demographics, practice 
settings, training, and education. Data were collected anonymously through 
REDCap, and participants were recruited via professional networks.
RESULTS: We received 30 responses, where 93.3% were from academic institutions 
and 86.2% engaged in research. Most order and interpret genetic testing and 
manage a range of phenotypes, including epilepsy, movement disorders, and 
neuromuscular diseases. Ninety percent of respondents use precision therapies, 
and 50% participate in clinical trials.
CONCLUSIONS: The survey underscores the demand for neurogenetics expertise in 
both diagnostic and therapeutic contexts. The study highlighted barriers such as 
limited staffing, training for a larger workforce capacity, and infrastructure 
challenges in integrating genetic testing into routine clinical practice. We 
summarize the factors that can promote the establishment and growth of 
neurogenetics programs. The integration of genetic counselors in clinics and 
genetics-focused education in neurology residencies are crucial for advancing 
equitable access to care.

BACKGROUND: Enteric Hyperoxaluria (EH) is a risk factor for calcium oxalate 
nephrolithiasis and kidney disease. The study compares patient characteristics 
and urine metabolic profiles at the time of EH diagnosis and kidney stones and 
end stage kidney disease (ESKD) events during follow-up in a cohort with diverse 
causes of EH.
METHODS: Adult patients with newly documented elevated urinary oxalate excretion 
(UOX) >40 mg/24hr between 1/1/2010 to 10/31/2023 and a known enteric diagnosis 
including inflammatory bowel disease, Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency (EPI), 
Celiac disease, Structural Intestinal Malabsorption (SIM), or Malabsorptive 
Bariatric surgery (Bariatric) were identified. Event rates and cumulative 
incidence of kidney stones and ESKD were assessed.
RESULTS: Among 814 identified patients, the most common enteric etiology was 
Bariatric (n=524, 64%). Patients with ulcerative colitis had the highest 
prevalence of kidney stones at EH diagnosis (93.6%) compared to other enteric 
etiologies (p=0.002). Patients with SIM had the highest urinary oxalate, lower 
urinary citrate, and volume, compared to other enteric etiologies (p<0.05). 
Calcium oxalate supersaturation was similar among the enteric groups (p=0.67). 
Median stone event rate for the overall cohort was 0.70 stone events/year during 
a mean (SD) follow-up of 5.0 (3.9) years. The SIM and EPI groups experienced the 
highest stone events (median (IQR) 1.24 (0.28, 2.40) and 1.20 (0.41, 1.99) 
events/year, respectively) while the Bariatric group had the lowest event rates 
(median (IQR) 0.45 (0.00, 1.66 events/year)) (p<0.001). The SIM group had the 
highest ESKD incidence (17.8% 5 years post-diagnosis; log-rank test p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: We describe a large EH cohort from diverse enteric etiologies. 
Significant heterogeneity exists in patient characteristics, urine metabolic 
risk factors and adverse kidney outcomes. Patients with SIM and EPI experienced 
the highest kidney stone events and patients with SIM had the highest ESKD 
incidence. This study highlights the urgent need for more granular information 
regarding the natural history and risk factors for kidney complications for EH 
patients to support interventional trials to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) 
in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is 
associated with improved survival. This study evaluated the association of 
disease extent at presentation and response to NAC with overall survival (OS) in 
HER2+ breast cancer.
METHODS: Patients with clinical stage I to III HER2+ breast cancer (2013-2020) 
who underwent NAC and received HER2-targeted therapy were identified from the 
National Cancer Database. Overall survival was assessed by clinical stage at 
presentation and chemotherapy response, stratified by hormone receptor (HR) 
status using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS: The study included 57,671 patients. Among the patients with pCR, OS at 
5 years was 98% for stage I, 97% for stage II, and 91% for stage III disease (p 
< 0.001). Among patients with residual disease, OS at 5 years was 95% for stage 
I, 91% for stage II, and 80% for stage III disease (p < 0.001). Multivariable 
analysis showed that stage III HR-/HER2+ disease with pCR did not have OS 
different from stage I breast cancer with residual disease (hazard ratio, 1.17; 
p = 0.34). Stage II HR+/HER2+ disease with pCR did not have OS different from 
stage I breast cancer with residual disease (hazard ratio, 0.94; p = 0.61), and 
stage III disease with pCR had worse OS (hazard ratio, 1.90; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among the patients who had HER2+ breast cancer treated with NAC, 
the clinical stage at presentation was associated with OS for those with pCR and 
residual disease. Patients with stage III HER2+ breast cancer and those with 
stage II HR+/HER2+ breast cancer who achieve pCR could benefit from further 
studies that evaluate potential escalation of adjuvant therapies.

Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Cardiometabolic Disease: Obesity, Hypertension, and

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder, 
characterized by recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep, resulting in 
intermittent hypoxia, increased sympathetic activation, and sleep deficiency. 
Over the past 2 decades, there has been a robust body of evidence to support a 
strong link between OSA and cardiometabolic diseases. Obesity is an important 
risk factor for OSA. Observational studies indicate that OSA is a strong risk 
factor for the development of hypertension and diabetes. Moreover, clinical and 
experimental studies support a causal role of OSA in hypertension and 
impairments in glucose metabolism, beyond excess weight. Notably, OSA is 
particularly underdiagnosed and undertreated in women, which may heighten the 
cardiometabolic risk. OSA is often overlooked during pregnancy and has been 
linked to adverse cardiometabolic outcomes in observational studies. In 
randomized clinical trials, treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway 
pressure reduces blood pressure in individuals with hypertension, but the 
beneficial effects of continuous positive airway pressure on glycemic outcomes 
are less convincing. Inconsistent cardiometabolic response to OSA treatment can 
be partly explained by failure to consider heterogeneity in OSA and variable 
continuous positive airway pressure adherence among diverse populations. In this 
review, we summarize the relationships between OSA and cardiometabolic 
conditions with a particular focus on obesity, hypertension, and diabetes. We 
review the current knowledge on the heterogeneity in OSA and discuss potential 
underlying mechanisms for impairments in blood pressure and glucose metabolism 
in OSA. We also provide a clinical perspective for OSA management considering 
current research gaps and emerging approaches for the prevention and treatment 
of cardiometabolic disease.

INTRODUCTION: Artificial intelligence (AI) is expanding rapidly in healthcare, 
particularly in gastroenterology (GI). Applications include enhancing 
colonoscopy accuracy, identifying dysplasia, and predicting clinical outcomes in 
inflammatory bowel disease. Despite AI's potential, concerns about ethical use 
and inadequate training persist.
AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the perceptions and understanding of AI among 
U.S. GI trainees and early career professionals.
METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among members of the American 
College of Gastroenterology. The survey assessed AI experience, confidence, and 
educational needs, with comparisons between fellows and early career. Fisher's 
exact test and multivariate regressions were applied to assess differences in 
responses.
RESULTS: A total of 193 respondents completed the survey (54.1% fellows, 45.9% 
early career). Most respondents (73%) were aged 25-35, and 91.6% believed AI 
would significantly impact healthcare. Only 6.7% currently use AI in practice, 
with fellows less likely to use AI compared to early career gastroenterologists 
(65.4 vs. 82.0%, P = 0.031). Confidence was low overall, with fellows reporting 
significantly less confidence in interpreting AI findings (P = 0.025) and 
understanding AI limitations (P = 0.050). A notable gap in the basic 
understanding of AI concepts, such as machine learning and neural networks, was 
evident among both groups, particularly fellows. Common concerns included misuse 
(64.2%), data privacy (40.2%), and financial costs (32.7%).
CONCLUSIONS: Interest in AI is high, but confidence and experience are limited. 
Ethical concerns and knowledge gaps highlight the urgent need for structured AI 
education in GI training. Comprehensive AI curricula focusing on practical use, 
critical interpretation, and ethics are strongly needed to equip 
gastroenterologists with the skills for responsible and effective clinical 
integration.

INTRODUCTION: Device-based therapies for treating atrial fibrillation 
(AF) episodes are limited. Using pulsed electric fields (PEF) to induce 
reversible electroporation of cardiac tissue may effectively terminate AF. Thus, 
we aimed to assess the feasibility of PEF delivery for converting atrial 
arrhythmias via reversible electroporation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Four swine models were used in this acute study. 
Custom-made decapolar catheters for PEF delivery were deployed with the 
following configurations: (1) Endocardial right atrium (RA) and coronary sinus 
(CS), n = 2; and (2) Endocardial RA and epicardial left atrium (epiLA), n = 2. 
AF and atrial flutter (AFL) were induced with programmed stimulation. PEF 
delivery was performed using the BTX 830 generator. For each attempt, a single 
monophasic pulse at 10 or 20 µs pulse width was administered, with voltage 
varied across attempts (range 750-3000 V). Successful (type 1 and 2 breaks) and 
unsuccessful conversion attempts were recorded. Post-PEF signal changes and 
arrhythmias were identified. A total of 58 AF/AFL (28 and 30 respectively) 
episodes were induced. Of the 37 successful conversion attempts, 33 (89.1%) were 
type 1 breaks. Conversion success probabilities generally increased with higher 
voltages for both configurations. Greater than 70% conversion success was seen 
with ≥ 1500 V for the RA/CS configuration and ≥ 2000 V for the RA/epiLA 
configuration. Arrhythmias including intra-atrial delay and high-grade 
atrioventricular block were seen, usually following successive PEF deliveries. 
Significant muscle stimulation was provoked with the current experimental setup.
CONCLUSION: Termination of atrial arrhythmias with PEF delivery is feasible, 
although further work is required to optimize its efficacy and safety.

In recent years, the utilization of immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome 
inhibitors and CD38 targeting monoclonal antibodies has led to significant 
improvements in the overall outcomes of patients with multiple myeloma. Despite 
these advances, relapse remains common, and until recently, the prognosis of 
such patients was guarded. The approval of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) 
T-cells and T-cell engagers (TCE) have considerably improved the survival in 
these patients with triple and penta-class refractory disease. This paper 
reviews the clinical outcomes associated with these novel immunotherapeutic 
agents, including their associated toxicities, their role and optimal sequencing 
within the treatment landscape of multiple myeloma. The importance of supportive 
care in managing these patients will be discussed. Finally, we offer a 
perspective on emerging developments in the immunotherapy of relapsed multiple 
myeloma.

This review delves into the realm of gallium-68 (68Ga)-labeled 
radiopharmaceuticals. Over the last decade, 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceuticals 
have gained prominence and shown tremendous growth in both preclinical 
evaluation and clinical translation due to their accessibility, favourable 
physical properties, and simple chemistry. Despite the high positron emission 
energy of 836 keV, it has been extensively used in diagnostic imaging. The 
present review aims to elucidate the status of various potential and clinically 
relevant 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceuticals, as well as their preclinical and 
clinical stages. In this review article, we briefly discuss the physical 
characteristics, mode of production, suitable bifunctional chelators, and 
radiolabeling chemistry of 68Ga. Various 68Ga-labeled radiopharmaceuticals are 
discussed with respect to their biological targets, preclinical results, 
clinical results if available, and their current state of readiness for clinical 
translation and application in humans.

The Artist Mindset: A Collaborative Autoethnography by a Poet and a 
Psychiatrist.

Converging evidence supports the idea that engaging in the arts can benefit 
mental health. However, the mechanisms underlying such effects are poorly 
understood. To gain insights that would be useful to the arts-in-health field, 
the current paper applied collaborative autoethnography to the questions, "How 
do artists manage their creative process? How might this process be helpful for 
adolescents with depression?" In an unstructured exchange that took place over 
5 years, the two authors (a poet/teaching artist and a child and adolescent 
psychiatrist/researcher) explored the intersection of the artist's strategies 
for creative practice and mental health. Personal narratives, analytic memos, 
and detailed conversations exchanged through emails were collected and reviewed 
through the reflexive lens of collaborative autoethnography, by exploring the 
artist author's personal experiences from her creative practice, and the child 
psychiatrist author's reflexive responses, drawing on her patient care 
experience. Through the conversations, both authors became aware of the 
connection between the goal of the artist (to create art) and the goal of the 
physician (to aid in healing). The authors extracted six strategies and 
developed a concept framework, "artist mindset," which also had significant 
potential relevance to adolescents who are navigating depression. The artist 
mindset, a set of strategies that can promote creative practice but also holds 
promise in application to navigating depression, offers a helpful framework and 
a unique approach to treatment.

Bile acids are a major component of gastro-esophageal refluxate, thought to 
contribute to the development of Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (EAC). As the microbiome shifts with EAC progression and bile 
acids influence bacterial composition, we examined these connections in a 
multi-center, cross-sectional study. We analyzed biospecimens from patients 
undergoing endoscopy using LC-MS to quantify bile acids in gastric aspirates, 
16S rRNA sequencing for tissue microbiome profiling, and RNA sequencing on BE or 
cardia tissue. Among 153 patients (52 controls, 101 BE: 50 no dysplasia, 10 
indefinite, 17 low-grade dysplasia, 17 high-grade dysplasia, and 7 EAC), we 
observed increased Streptococcus in BE tissue; dysplasia and EAC were associated 
with more Lactobacillus and decreased Actinomyces and other genera. Refluxate 
bile acids were mainly conjugated, indicating minimal bacterial metabolism, 
while BE patients had elevated secondary bile acid levels. Streptococcus 
correlated with upregulation of IL6, FGF2, and HGF, and decreased Actinomyces 
showed the most associations with gene expression, including the oxidative 
phosphorylation pathway. We identified two distinct BE gene expression clusters 
independent of histology, bile acid, or microbiome composition. These findings 
suggest bile acids shape the BE microbiome and associate with gene expression 
changes potentially relevant to EAC development.

IMPORTANCE: Influenza vaccination coverage in the US is low, due largely to 
vaccine hesitancy. Personalized messages from trusted physicians may raise 
vaccination rates.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of physician-created videos and infographics 
containing physician photographs on influenza vaccination rates.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 3-arm randomized clinical trial included 
patients from 6 months to older than 65 years of age served by 21 primary care 
physicians in 21 practices at UCLA Health who were listed in the electronic 
health record as not receiving influenza vaccination between October 31, 2023, 
and April 1, 2024.
INTERVENTION: Patients within each physician patient population were randomized 
to receive usual care or a physician-created video or an infographic with their 
physician's photograph encouraging receipt of influenza vaccinations. Primary 
care physicians used a suggested script to create a brief video with their 
smartphone or a video conference recording, or an infographic containing their 
photograph and a similar script was created, both encouraging patients to 
receive influenza vaccinations. The video or infographic was sent via the 
patient portal up to 3 times (October, November, and December).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: All analyses used the evaluable patient population. 
The primary outcome was end-of-season influenza vaccination rates by Aril 1, 
2024. A secondary outcome was timely vaccination by December 31, 2023.
RESULTS: Among 22 233 patients, 3200 were children younger than 18 years 
(14.4%), 14 704 were adults 18 to 64 years of age (66.1%), and 4329 were adults 
65 years or older (19.5%); 13 973 (62.8%) were female. Overall, 18 878 patients 
(84.9%) had private insurance. The rates of influenza vaccination across the 
entire study population by April 1, 2024, were 3479 of 7417 (46.9%) for usual 
care, 3557 of 7410 (48.0%) for the video arm, and 3518 of 7406 (47.5%) for the 
infographic arm. Neither intervention had significantly higher rates of 
vaccination than usual care (adjusted risk ratio, 1.03 [95% CI, 1.00-1.06] for 
the video group; adjusted risk ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.99-1.06] for the 
infographic group). In the post hoc analysis, children in both intervention arms 
had higher vaccination rates by April 1, 2024: 618 of 1058 children in the video 
group (58.4%) (P < .001) and 598 of 1085 children in the infographics group 
(55.1%), each compared with 576 of 1057 (54.5%) in the usual care group 
(P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, neither 
physician-created videos nor infographics increased influenza overall 
vaccination rates by April 1, 2024. However, among children, both interventions 
were effective by end of influenza season. Messages personalized by physicians 
may represent a potential strategy to improve influenza vaccination among 
children, but further innovations are needed across the entire age spectrum.

Background  Salvage procedures for failed total wrist arthroplasty have variable 
results and limitations such as donor site morbidity, malunion, delayed or 
nonunion. We present a case of substantial bone loss after failed wrist 
arthroplasty and a surgical technique in which the distal ulna is transferred 
and intussuscepted to achieve union between the residual distal radius and 
metacarpals. Case Description  A 48-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis 
presented with wrist prosthetic joint infection 16 years after total wrist 
arthroplasty. With extensive bone loss following implant removal and multiple 
debridements, the remaining distal ulna was resected and intussuscepted between 
the residual radius and second and third metacarpals. The patient achieved 
incorporation of the graft at 12 weeks and fusion at 20 weeks, with resolution 
of pain and restoration of digit function at 2 years. Literature Review 
 Standard means of wrist arthrodesis utilizing iliac crest autograft and femoral 
head allograft may be limited to address substantial bone loss following total 
wrist implant removal. Intussusception has been utilized in the elbow, hip, and 
diaphysis to optimize graft-host bone contact and achieve union. While 
ulna-utilizing procedures have been described for oncologic and traumatic 
indications, to our knowledge, double intussusception has not been described for 
salvage procedures after failed wrist arthroplasty. Clinical Relevance 
 Intussuscepting the distal ulna within the distal radius and metacarpals as an 
interpositional arthrodesis provides autologous graft, increased surface 
contact, and length restoration in cases of poor bone quality and significant 
bone loss following revision of a total wrist implant.

BACKGROUND: Intracardiac echocardiography guidance has emerged as a feasible 
alternative to transesophageal echocardiography in guiding left atrial appendage 
occlusion (LAAO). A proposed advantage of this approach is the avoidance of 
cognitive impairment associated with general anesthesia (GA) in elderly 
patients.
OBJECTIVES: We studied the effect of anesthesia method (GA vs moderate sedation 
[MS]) on cognitive function using a novel digital oculomotor biomarker.
METHODS: Patients undergoing LAAO were prospectively enrolled at 2 medical 
centers (GA center and MS center). Cognitive function was assessed at baseline 
(V1), 6 hours post-LAAO (V2), and at 45 days (V3) using the ViewMind system, 
which consists of a head-mounted device with eye-tracking capabilities. We 
examined differences in cognitive function as measured by 2 oculomotor tests 
(Go/No Go and N-Back), within each group between V1 vs V2 and V1 vs V3.
RESULTS: Forty patients (20 in each group: GA and MS) were enrolled. Patients in 
the MS group showed significant long-term (V1 vs V3) improvement in working 
memory (Δ n complete sequences, P = 0.005), processing speed (Δ n wrong 
fixations, P = 0.050), and sustained attention (gazing recognition (ms), P = 
0.010), as measured by the N-Back task while there were no differences in the GA 
group (P = 0.180 for Δ n complete sequences, P = 0.410 for Δ n wrong fixations 
on hitbox, and P = 0.310 gazing recognition [msec]).
CONCLUSIONS: Memory-based oculomotor metrics improved after the procedure in 
patients undergoing LAAO under MS but not within the GA group. This 
proof-of-concept study supports a differential impact of sedation strategies on 
cognitive function in elderly patients undergoing LAAO.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of axillary surgery de-escalation trends on 
general surgery resident and breast surgical oncology fellow exposure to 
axillary lymph node dissection cases.
DESIGN: Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs were 
retrospectively analyzed with attention to change over time. Trends in axillary 
lymph node dissection were evaluated using univariate linear regression.
SETTING: Academic, tertiary medical center with a large general surgery 
residency and multiple surgical fellowship programs.
PARTICIPANTS: General surgery residents and breast surgical oncology fellows 
graduating from 2009-2024.
RESULTS: Axillary lymph node dissection experience is decreasing for general 
surgery residents (estimate -0.46 cases per resident/graduation year, 95% CI 
-0.73, -0.19; p = 0.0011), with a mean of 12.0 cases per resident graduating in 
2010 versus 6.1 cases in those graduating in 2024. Sentinel lymph node 
experience is preserved. Fellow axillary lymph node dissection experience is 
stable (p = 0.20) with a mean of 21.3 cases, however more recent fellow 
graduates have total numbers less than 20 cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in use of axillary lymph node dissection in clinical 
practice parallels a decline in resident experience with axillary lymph node 
dissection while fellow experience appears preserved. Continued attention to 
trends along with intentional case assignment and alternate/supplemental methods 
of education, such as video and simulation, may be valuable to educate residents 
on axillary lymph node dissection.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponin (cTn) levels exceeding the 99th percentile upper 
reference limit and a rise/fall pattern are key for diagnosing myocardial injury 
and infarction. Macrotroponins, formed by patient anti-cTn antibodies targeting 
cTn, can cause persistently elevated cTn levels without ongoing myocardial 
injury. The frequency and impact of macrotroponin interference on cTn 99th 
percentiles are unclear. This study compares sex-specific 99th percentiles for 2 
cTn assays, before and after excluding macrotroponin-positive samples, focusing 
on the top 10% of cTn levels.
METHODS: We examined 1058 plasma samples from healthy individuals previously 
used for Danish cTn 99th percentiles. Following International Federation of 
Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine educational recommendations, 
macrotroponin presence was assessed in the top 10% cTn samples using 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) depletion screening and a reference sucrose gradient, 
confirming macrotroponin when both methods concurred. Due to analytical dilution 
constraints, [the highest] 88 of 135 Siemens Atellica high-sensitivity cTnI 
(hs-cTnI) samples were analyzed with both methods. All 106 Roche hs-cTnT samples 
were negative using IgG depletion, and sucrose analysis was limited to the 
highest 70 samples.
RESULTS: Macrotroponin was found in 76% (67/88) of Siemens samples but in none 
of the Roche samples (0/70). Excluding macrotroponin-affected samples lowered 
the Siemens 99th percentiles from 117 ng/L to 22 ng/L in men and from 37 ng/L to 
9 ng/L in women. The 99th/50th percentile ratio for Siemens decreased from 12- 
to 29-fold to 3- to 7-fold, approaching the Roche ratios.
CONCLUSIONS: Macrotroponin significantly influenced the Siemens Atellica hs-cTnI 
99th percentiles, suggesting important clinical implications that warrant 
further prospective studies. The 99th/50th percentile ratio may help evaluate 
macrotroponin interference in troponin assays.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the performance of postoperative computed 
tomography (CT) and upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) in patients who 
underwent surgery for a perforated peptic ulcer and to assess the yield of 
routine postoperative studies.
METHODS: Retrospective, single-institution, chart-review study of patients who 
underwent a repair of a perforated gastric or duodenal ulcer between August 2004 
and September 2021 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 240 patients, 28 (12%) were found to have 
leaks. When any of the four findings (extraluminal gas or fluid collection 
adjacent to the repair, worsening pneumoperitoneum, or enteral contrast 
extravasation) was present on postoperative CT scan (n = 116) it had sensitivity 
of 76% (95% CI 53%-90%), with a specificity of 90% (95% CI 84%-91%). Upper 
gastrointestinal series (UGI, n = 150) showed a sensitivity of 57% (95% CI 
25%-84%) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI 96%-100%). UGI demonstrated higher 
specificity compared to CT (p < 0.01); there was no significant difference in 
sensitivity (p = 0.34). The findings from CT scans led to changes in management 
for a significantly greater number of patients compared to UGI (20% vs. 4%, 
p < 0.01). The diagnostic yield for leak identification was 3% for routine 
postoperative CT (n = 63) and 2% for routine UGI studies (n = 141).
CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative CT is more likely to change management in patients 
who underwent repair of a perforated peptic ulcer compared to postoperative 
upper gastrointestinal series. The yield of routine postoperative studies is 
low, and their benefit is uncertain.

INTRODUCTION: There has been a significant change in the treatment paradigm of 
biliary tract cancers (BTCs) in recent years with the introduction of 
chemoimmunotherapy and the development of targeted agents. In the present 
review, we describe the current landscape of systemic therapy for BTC and 
discuss forthcoming novel therapeutics.
AREAS COVERED: We completed a narrative review using pertinent clinical trials 
discussing systemic therapy for BTC listed on PubMed, as well as ongoing trials 
included on clinicaltrials.gov. We discuss evidence for use of systemic therapy 
in the adjuvant setting and review first- and second-line systemic therapy, 
including targeted agents, for treatment of advanced BTC.
EXPERT OPINION: Despite advances in systemic therapy for BTC, there is a high 
incidence of recurrence for resected diseases and the prognosis for metastatic 
diseases remains poor. Development and assessment of novel therapeutics will be 
essential going forward, as will research regarding means to overcome resistance 
mechanisms that limit efficacy of targeted agents.

Artificial intelligence (AI) will fundamentally improve how we perform clinical 
trials by addressing issues of standardizing disease scoring, improving the 
sensitivity and precision of activity and phenotype assessments, and automating 
laborious and time-consuming study functions. Progress in AI image analysis is 
quickly proving to replicate expert judgment in endoscopy, histology, and 
cross-sectional imaging with speed, reproducibility, and reduced bias. However, 
AI analytics offer the ability to quantify disease characteristics with more 
detail and precision than human experts. Large language models and generative AI 
are automating the collection of high-quality data from electronic records and 
improving our ability to predict patient outcomes. This narrative review will 
focus on AI tools available today, their expected implementation, and 
future-facing opportunities for AI to reimagine inflammatory bowel disease 
clinical trials.

Deep endometriosis demystified: Natural progression, hormonal treatment, and 
malignant transformation.

Stewart KA(1), Cope AG, Burnett TL, Green IC.

Author information:
(1)Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, 
USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We present a review of the natural progression, response to 
hormonal therapy, and risk of malignancy associated with deep endometriosis (DE) 
to guide evidence-based discussion of conservative treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: Advanced imaging protocols have enhanced nonsurgical detection 
of DE, allowing noninvasive diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance. While some 
DE is progressive, 50% of disease appears stable over time, and progression is 
reduced by half with hormonal treatments (21 versus 12%). Hormonal treatment can 
reduce the size of DE lesions by 1 cm³, with reductions occurring after 6 months 
and remaining stable up to 3 years. Most hormonal therapies improve symptoms and 
quality of life, regardless of changes in DE size, with combined contraceptives 
and progestins being the most studied. DE may present a higher risk of ovarian 
and extraovarian cancer than previously hypothesized, though further research is 
needed to confirm findings. Limitations of DE research include differing imaging 
strategies, definitions of disease and progression, short follow-up, focus on 
rectosigmoid DE only, and lack of randomized trials.
SUMMARY: DE is a subtype of endometriosis that is increasingly diagnosed and 
treated with noninvasive strategies. Hormonal treatments improve symptoms and 
reduce progression of DE. Further research on optimal conservative management 
and risk of malignancy is warranted.

BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) and 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) improve cardiovascular and 
kidney outcomes, but accessibility concerns persist. Whether access is worse in 
rural communities is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To examine fills of GLP1RA/SGLT2i by adults with type 2 diabetes in 
rural and urban US counties.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional use claims from OptumLabs® Data Warehouse, 2012-2021.
PATIENTS: Adults with type 2 diabetes.
MAIN MEASURES: We examined rates and odds of fills of GLP1RA or SGLT2i, 
adjusting for time period, age, sex, presence of cardiorenal comorbidities 
(heart failure [HF], atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [ASCVD], chronic 
kidney disease stages 3-4 [CKD]), and rurality.
KEY RESULTS: The study included 2,579,577 adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age 
63.9; 49.6% female). Compared to 2012-2015, fills of GLP1RA/SGLT2i increased in 
2016-2018 (OR 2.49; 95% CI 2.47-2.52) and 2019-2021 (OR 4.35; 95% CI 4.30-4.39). 
By 2019-2021, the percentages of patients filling GLP1RA/SGLT2i in cities, small 
towns, and remote areas were 18.8%, 18.8%, and 17.4%, respectively. Small town 
residents had higher odds of fills than those in cities (OR 1.05; 95% CI 
1.04-1.06). Older age was associated with lower fill rates; compared to 
18-44 year olds, odds for those 45-64 years were OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.87-0.89), 
65-74 years: OR 0.48 (95% CI 0.47-0.48), and ≥ 75 years: OR 0.17 (95% CI 
0.17-0.18). Men were less likely to fill GLP1RA/SGLT2i than women (OR 0.91; 95% 
CI 0.90-0.92). Presence of ASCVD and CKD were associated with greater odds of 
filling GLP1RA/SGLT2i (OR 1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.05] and OR 1.12 [95% CI 
1.10-1.14], respectively), while HF was associated with lower odds (OR 0.86 [95% 
CI 0.85-0.88]).
CONCLUSIONS: GLP1RA and SGLT2i fills increased over time but remained low 
overall. They were filled more often by younger people, women, those with ASCVD 
or CKD (but not with HF), and in small towns.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical correlates of right ventricular function in 
advanced/stage D heart failure and its association with risks of death and 
hospitalizations in this population.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included adult residents of Olmsted 
County, Minnesota, with advanced heart failure between 2007 and 2018. Patients 
were classified by right ventricular function assessed by echocardiography at 
the time of advanced heart failure. The association of right ventricular 
function with risks of death and hospitalizations through June 30, 2023, was 
examined by Cox and Andersen-Gill models, respectively.
RESULTS: There were 925 patients included in the analysis (mean age, 77.2 years; 
44.5% women). Right ventricular function was normal in 29% (n=266), mildly 
reduced in 38% (n=349), and moderately to severely reduced in 33% (n=310). 
Percentage with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction was 60.2%, 41.3%, 
and 31.0% in patients with normal right ventricular function, mild right 
ventricular dysfunction, and moderate to severe right ventricular dysfunction, 
respectively (P<.001). Compared with patients with normal right ventricular 
function, moderate to severe right ventricular dysfunction was associated with 
increased risks of mortality: all-cause (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 
1.09 to 1.55) and cardiovascular (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06 to 
1.66). There was no significant difference in all-cause or heart 
failure-specific hospitalization risk by right ventricular function.
CONCLUSION: Right ventricular dysfunction was present in 71% patients with 
advanced heart failure and increased with decreasing left ventricular ejection 
fraction. Moderate to severe right ventricular dysfunction was associated with 
increased all-cause and cardiovascular death but had no association with 
hospitalizations.

Parameters detected by positron emission tomography (PET) are not included in 
the usual predictive indices for follicular lymphoma (FL). Data are lacking 
regarding PET extranodal (EN) factors that predict outcomes in FL. PET scans 
from 258 patients with untreated grade 1 to 3A FL included in the E2408 
randomized phase 2 trial were reviewed. Validation of the prognostic 
significance of PET factors identified in a previous retrospective study was 
performed. PET factors with a significant impact on survival outcomes were 
combined with significant FL International Prognostic Index 2 (FLIPI-2) factors 
to evaluate the predictive value of a PET-based prognostic index. Presence of ≥2 
EN sites and skin/soft tissue involvement on PET were validated as predictors of 
overall survival. These factors were combined with all FLIPI-2 factors except 
"positive bone marrow biopsy" to form a PET-based prognostic score. This novel 
score identified a group of patients at high risk of progression of disease at 
24 months. This PET-based score did not perform better than the traditional 
FLIPI-2 on additional analysis. Presence of ≥2 EN sites and skin/soft tissue 
involvement on PET predict poor outcomes in untreated FL. Further studies should 
be performed to determine the validity of a PET-based prognostic index in FL.

BACKGROUND: Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) undergoing lung 
cancer surgery face a 4.4-20 % risk of acute exacerbation (AE-IPF) with 
mortality exceeding 50 %. The potential role of perioperative antifibrotic 
therapy in reducing surgical complications in this high-risk population remains 
unclear.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether perioperative antifibrotic therapy 
(pirfenidone/nintedanib) reduces complications, particularly acute exacerbations 
and mortality, in IPF patients undergoing lung cancer surgery through systematic 
review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of observational studies examining perioperative antifibrotic 
therapy in IPF patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Four studies comprising 
261 patients (124 treated, 137 controls) from Japan and Italy (2016-2024) were 
analyzed. Pooled risk ratios were calculated using Review Manager 5.4. The study 
protocol was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42025649005).
RESULTS: Perioperative antifibrotic therapy achieved a 69 % reduction in AE-IPF 
risk (RR 0.31, 95 % CI 0.13-0.70) and an 81 % reduction in 90-day mortality (RR 
0.19, 95 % CI 0.07-0.52). Additional benefits included significantly shorter 
hospital stays (5 vs 7 days, p = 0.029) and reduced complications, including 
decreased prolonged air leak rates (3.4 % vs 26.9 %). Adverse events were 
minimal, consisting primarily of mild nausea and photosensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative antifibrotic therapy significantly reduces acute 
exacerbations and mortality in IPF patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. 
However, findings are limited by small observational studies concentrated in 
specific geographic regions. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm 
efficacy and establish standardized treatment protocols.

Pulmonary hypertension is a complex and irreversible pulmonary vascular disease 
with a significant impact on patients' lives. Pulmonary hypertension is 
categorized into five groups according to its etiology. Frailty is a 
multifaceted disorder that leads to physical, social, cognitive, and 
psychological decline. Several studies have linked a high occurrence of frailty 
to heart failure and chronic lung diseases, but the prevalence and impact of 
frailty in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remain largely unexplored. At 
the molecular level, inflammation, oxidative stress, cellular senescence, and 
mitochondrial dysfunction play pivotal roles in the pathophysiology of frailty 
in pulmonary hypertension. Dysfunction of cardiac, respiratory, and skeletal 
muscles results in exercise intolerance, which promotes deconditioning and 
frailty. Exercise training in PAH, heart failure, and chronic lung disease has 
shown promise in improving quality of life, exertion tolerance, and frailty 
scores. Properly designed studies are needed to elucidate the predictive value 
of frailty and to identify assessment and treatment tools in pulmonary 
hypertension, particularly PAH, to aid clinicians in individualizing care plans 
and improving patient outcomes. In this narrative review, we describe the 
pathobiology of frailty in pulmonary hypertension, assessment tools, the impact 
of frailty on different pulmonary hypertension groups, and suggestions for 
potential interventions.

BACKGROUND: Prompt detection and intervention are crucial for improving outcomes 
in acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFS). Diagnostic prediction models 
assist in risk-stratification, but their accuracy requires testing through 
external validation. This study aims to validate a previously published 
diagnostic prediction model for AIFS in an independent cohort.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at a tertiary care center 
(2008-2023) to identify patients with an otolaryngology consult for suspected 
AIFS. Of 65 patients identified, 11 (16.9%) were diagnosed with AIFS based on 
histopathology. Risk was calculated using Yin et al.'s predictive model. 
Predictive performance was assessed by calibration and discrimination.
RESULTS: Patients had significantly higher rates of diabetes (46.2% vs. 26.1%, p 
= 0.002), long-term steroid use (60% vs. 28.2%, p < 0.0001), and solid organ 
transplantation (38.5% vs. 8.5%, p < 0.001), compared with the development 
cohort, with conversely lower rates of hematologic malignancy (29.2% vs. 58.7, p 
< 0.001) and neutropenia (19.4% vs. 41%, p = 0.001). Despite these differences, 
both the three-variable (C-index: 0.844; 95% CI, 0.736-0.952) and four-variable 
models (C-index: 0.963; 95% CI, 0.919-1) showed adequate discrimination. Both 
models exhibited slight overprediction of risk, with a calibration-in-the-large 
predicted risk of 24.1% (95% CI, 13.68-34.46) for the three-variable model and 
24.2% (95% CI, 13.76-34.57) for the four-variable model. Calibration plots 
confirmed overprediction.
CONCLUSION: The AIFS diagnostic model demonstrates acceptable discrimination and 
calibration on external validation, with generalizability to patients with 
different comorbidities. Larger studies are recommended to further test the 
model's predictive performance and clinical applicability.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of glenoid and 
humeral component malposition in failed primary shoulder arthroplasty requiring 
revision. We hypothesized that glenoid and humeral component malposition would 
be a prevalent feature in cases requiring revision arthroplasty for primary 
anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), primary reverse shoulder 
arthroplasty (RSA), and primary hemiarthroplasty procedures.
METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed focusing on 
identifying the incidence of malpositioned components in shoulder arthroplasty 
in quantitative and qualitative reviews. A total of 234 consecutive cases from 3 
institutions were included in the study. Past surgical and radiographic data 
relative to the primary and revision surgeries were collected by each of the 3 
investigative institutions, and radiographs were reviewed by an independent 
reviewer. Descriptive data are summarized as means, ± standard deviations, or 
frequency (%). An Exact McNemar's test was used to compare frequencies between 
the independent reviewer and the institutions when appropriate, with 
significance set at P = .05.
RESULTS: Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the majority of glenoid 
components in these revision cases were malpositioned in both TSA (51%) and RSA 
(93%) when all measures were considered. Similarly, there was humeral component 
malposition in 57% of TSA cases, 62% of RSA cases, and 54% of hemiarthroplasty 
cases when all measures were considered. When asked if there was glenoid 
component malposition, the independent reviewer considered 17% of glenoid 
components to be malpositioned in TSA cases and 54% in RSA cases. The 
investigative institutions reported similar rates (P = .585). For the humeral 
side, the independent reviewer felt that 71% of TSA cases, 24% of RSA cases, and 
74% of hemiarthroplasty implants were malpositioned in some direction. The 
investigative institutions reported similar rates (P = .087).
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The data from this study suggest that component 
malposition is frequently present among patients requiring revision 
arthroplasty. Component malposition was not just frequently present, but also 
occurred in consistent patterns. Moreover, while significant attention has been 
placed on the impact of glenoid malposition, this study highlights the 
previously underappreciated high incidence of humeral component malposition in 
cases requiring revision arthroplasty.

BACKGROUND: Geriatric screening and multidisciplinary assessment of older adults 
in the Emergency Department (ED) decrease hospitalizations and ED revisits. The 
impact on patient-reported outcomes of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) 
and functional status is not known.
METHODS: A hybrid type II implementation/effectiveness prospective cohort study 
was conducted in an academic ED. The intervention bundle was geriatric screening 
for delirium, fall risk, and transition of care needs, and multidisciplinary 
assessment. All older adults (≥ 65 years) placed in the ED observation unit were 
eligible. HRQoL and functional status were obtained at the ED visit, 30, and 
90 days, and were compared between the pre- and post-intervention implementation 
cohorts. Secondary outcomes included ED revisits, falls, mortality, and 
intervention adoption measures.
RESULTS: From 2019 to 2023, 368 adults participated in the study: Most were 
community-dwelling (97%) and had multiple comorbidities. The pre (n = 138) and 
post (n = 230) cohorts did not differ in baseline functional status or HRQoL. 
The rate of geriatric screening improved from 12.3% in the pre-implementation 
cohort to 91.3% in the post-implementation cohort (p < 0.01). Multispecialty 
consultation also increased (68.1%-91.3%, p < 0.01). The proportion who had a 
post-ED visit decline in functional status did not differ between cohorts. 
Physical HRQoL declined similarly in both cohorts (-0.73 vs. -0.33, p = 0.61) at 
90 days. Mental HRQoL improved in both cohorts; improvement was greater in the 
pre-cohort (2.35 vs. 0.32, p = 0.02). ED revisits and re-hospitalizations were 
unchanged (30 days: 23.0% vs. 17.2%, p = 0.18, and 90 days: 37.8% vs. 34.8%, 
p = 0.57). The intervention decreased falls at 30 and 90 days (30 days: 9.7% vs. 
3.2%, p = 0.04; 90 days: 22.1% vs. 7.9%, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatric screening in the ED increased identification of geriatric 
syndromes and multidisciplinary consultation. The intervention was associated 
with decreased falls but did not affect HRQoL or reduce functional decline post 
ED visit.

OBJECTIVES: Large language models (LLMs) offer potential in natural language 
processing tasks in healthcare. Due to the need for high accuracy, understanding 
their limitations is essential. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 
performance of LLMs in classifying radiology reports for the presence of 
pulmonary embolism (PE) under various conditions, including different prompt 
designs and data perturbations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, institutional review board 
approved study, we evaluated 3 Google's LLMs including Gemini-1.5-Pro, 
Gemini-1.5-Flash-001, and Gemini-1.5-Flash-002, in classifying 11 999 pulmonary 
CT angiography radiology reports for PE. Ground truth labels were determined by 
concordance between a computer vision-based PE detection (CVPED) algorithm and 
multiple LLM runs under various configurations. Discrepancies between 
algorithms' classifications were aggregated and manually reviewed. We evaluated 
the effects of prompt design, data perturbations, and repeated analyses across 
geographic cloud regions. Performance metrics were calculated.
RESULTS: Of 11 999 reports, 1296 (10.8%) were PE-positive. Accuracy across LLMs 
ranged between 0.953 and 0.996. The highest recall rate for a prompt modified 
after a review of the misclassified cases (up to 0.997). Few-shot prompting 
improved recall (up to 0.99), while chain-of-thought generally degraded 
performance. Gemini-1.5-Flash-002 demonstrated the highest robustness against 
data perturbations. Geographic cloud region variability was minimal for 
Gemini-1.5+-Pro, while the Flash models showed stable performance.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: LLMs demonstrated high performance in classifying 
radiology reports, though results varied with prompt design and data quality. 
These findings underscore the need for systematic evaluation and validation of 
LLMs for clinical applications, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

OBJECTIVES: This study seeks to create consensus-based definitions of signs and 
symptoms of giant cell arteritis (GCA) for use by health care professionals, 
primarily in research settings.
METHODS: Core definitions of signs and symptoms of GCA were extracted from 11 
randomised controlled trials of GCA previously reviewed in a systematic 
literature review conducted in the context of the development of response 
criteria for GCA. This information was supplemented by definitions from other 
sources, such as rheumatology textbooks. A 2-round Delphi was performed within 
an international task force (32 members from 11 countries). The first round 
aimed to obtain consensus on the descriptive terms defining each sign or 
symptom, and round 2 rated the importance of these terms. Based on the Delphi 
study method, preliminary definitions were developed. In 4 online meetings, 
results of the Delphi were reviewed, and a consensus was achieved on final 
definitions.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine signs and symptoms of GCA were reviewed. Six signs or 
symptoms of GCA had previously been defined in the literature. A high level of 
agreement was reached on the definition of 23 signs and symptoms with the 
following 12 considered characteristic of GCA: headache, temporal artery 
abnormalities, scalp tenderness, scalp necrosis, jaw claudication, tongue 
claudication, tongue necrosis, amaurosis fugax, permanent vision loss, fever, 
limb claudication, and blood pressure inequality.
CONCLUSIONS: A glossary of definitions for 23 signs and symptoms of GCA was 
developed through a consensus process involving international experts.

"Counting What We Save-and What We Never Have to Spend: Cost Savings and Cost 
Avoidance from an AI-Enabled Pharmacy Workflow".

BACKGROUND: Clinical trial protocols are highly complex documents that outline 
the objectives, design, methodology, statistical considerations, and operational 
details of a study. Departments, such as nursing, pharmacy, and labs, create 
tailored summaries that allow others in their field to efficiently access 
information without combing through hundreds of pages of a protocol. Creating 
these summaries can be time intensive and are a barrier to study activation. 
With increasing complexity of study design and momentum towards individualized 
medicine, AI-assisted workflows may present an opportunity to increase 
efficiency and reduce study overhead.
OBJECTIVES: Determine the impact of AI-assisted workflows in preparing pharmacy 
clinical trial documents.
METHODS: A generative AI prompt was developed to produce summaries which include 
elements of manually created summaries. Pharmacists completed summaries manually 
and with AI assistance in parallel. Studies were selected sequentially, with all 
new trials submitted within the stated observation timeframe considered for 
assessment. Time required to complete summaries was compared between manual and 
AI-assisted methods, and a cost-effectiveness and cost-avoidance analysis was 
performed.
RESULTS: An AI-assisted workflow cut pharmacy summary-sheet preparation time 80% 
(148 → 30 min), yielding a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) 
of -$97 per hour saved and a net monetary benefit (NMB) of $423 per task 
(∼$30,000 annually for six pharmacists). One-way sensitivity analyses across 
productivity, salary, fringe, and IT overhead ranges all stayed cost-saving; the 
worst case still delivered a NMB of $465. A 10-year Monte-Carlo analysis varying 
AI price growth, performance drift, upgrade shocks, and labor inflation never 
crossed break-even (mean discounted NMB $294 k, (95 % CI $265-323 k).
CONCLUSION: AI automation reliably frees pharmacist time, curbs costs, and 
scales favorably as trial volume grows across diverse settings and future 
documentation-intensive pharmacy tasks. This study evaluates the 
cost-effectiveness of implementing an AI-assisted workflow for pharmacy summary 
sheet creation in clinical trials. We compare the AI workflow to a traditional 
manual process, analyzing labor costs, time efficiency, incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). Findings 
indicate significant cost savings and efficiency gains, supporting the adoption 
of AI-driven automation.

Sharing diverse genomic and other biomedical datasets is critical to advancing 
scientific discoveries and their equitable translation to improve human health. 
However, data sharing remains challenging in the context of legacy datasets, 
evolving policies, multi-institutional consortium science, and international 
stakeholders. The NIH-funded Polygenic Risk Methods in Diverse Populations 
(PRIMED) Consortium was established to improve the performance of polygenic risk 
estimates for a broad range of health and disease outcomes with global impacts. 
Improving polygenic risk score performance across genetically diverse 
populations requires access to large, diverse cohorts. We report on the design 
and implementation of data-sharing policies and procedures developed in PRIMED 
to aggregate and analyze data from multiple heterogeneous sources while adhering 
to pre-existing data-sharing policies for each integrated dataset and respecting 
participant preferences and informed consent. Specifically, we describe two 
primary data-sharing mechanisms-coordinated dbGaP applications and a Consortium 
Data Sharing Agreement-and provide alternatives when individual-level data 
cannot be shared within the Consortium (e.g., federated analyses). We also 
describe technical implementation of Consortium data sharing in the NHGRI 
Analysis Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) cloud platform to share 
derived individual-level data, genomic summary results, and methods workflows 
with appropriate permissions. As a consortium making secondary use of 
pre-existing data sources, we also discuss challenges and propose solutions for 
release of individual- and summary-level data products to the broader scientific 
community. We make recommendations for ongoing and future policymaking with the 
goal of informing future consortia and other research activities.

Artificial neural networks are now used across many fields, from medicine to 
chatbots. However, they are often complicated and give "black-box" predictions. 
To better understand these models, we outline some of the terminology, provide 
example applications in solid organ transplantation, and offer recommendations 
for those interested in starting to use such models. Examples and definitions 
are sourced from PubMed searches as well as a review of several applied texts in 
machine and deep learning. Neural networks have been applied in transplantation 
since the 1990s, but more recent applications involve their use to process 
nontabular data, such as images and text. Although interpretations of model 
results should take context into account, the power of these models holds great 
potential for the future in transplantation.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the real-world impact of artificial intelligence-driven 
decision support imaging software for patients with acute ischemic stroke in a 
mature telestroke network in the United States.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective evaluation of stroke imaging 
support software in a robust, predominantly rural telestroke network (17 sites 
in Minnesota and Wisconsin). Data was collected from all patients who underwent 
video telestroke evaluation in a 3-month preimplementation period before 
installation of the software (from February 10, 2024 to May 9, 2024) and a 
3-month postimplementation period while the software was in use (from May 10, 
2024 to August 9, 2024). The preimplementation and postimplementation cohorts 
were directly compared (no control group included). Primary outcome measures 
were treatment rates and time to treatment (both treatment decision and 
delivery) for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular therapy (EVT); 
secondary outcomes included transfer rates, transfer times, and end user survey 
results.
RESULTS: Total of 444 telestroke cases were included in the preimplementation 
period, and 463 in the postimplementation period. Comparing preimplementation 
and postimplementation periods, the rate of IVT treatment delivery rose from 
26.6% to 35.0% of potentially eligible patients (P=.24), whereas EVT treatment 
delivery remained at 31%. Time to IVT delivery reduced from 47 minutes to 41 
minutes (P=.772), and time to EVT treatment rose from 156 minutes to 157 minutes 
(P=.771). Overall rates of treatment (IVT or EVT) rose from 23.1% to 23.9% of 
potentially eligible patients (P=.944). Although none of the clinical outcomes 
reached statistical significance, the survey results reported good user 
satisfaction with algorithm performance and image viewing.
CONCLUSION: This study reported a nonsignificant increase in treatment rates and 
a decrease in time to treatment decisions. Future trials with larger sample 
sizes are needed to validate the real-world benefits of decision support 
software for acute ischemic stroke in an established telestroke network.

Background/Objectives: High-risk percutaneous coronary interventions (HR-PCIs) 
often require mechanical circulatory support (MCS) to maintain hemodynamic 
stability. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) and percutaneous left ventricular 
assist device (PLVAD) are two commonly used MCS devices that differ in their 
mechanisms. We aimed to evaluate and compare the clinical outcomes associated 
with IABP and PLVAD use in HR-PCIs without cardiogenic shock. Methods: We 
conducted a search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, Mendeley, Web of Science, and 
Embase to identify relevant randomized controlled trials and cohort studies, and 
we included 13 studies for the systematic review and meta-analysis. The primary 
goal was to define the difference in early mortality (in-hospital and 30-day 
mortality), major bleeding, and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) 
components (cardiogenic shock, acute kidney injury (AKI), and stroke/TIA) in 
IABP and PLVAD. We used a random-effects model with the Mantel-Haenszel 
statistical method to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. 
Results: Among 1 trial and 12 cohort studies (35,554 patients; 30,351 IABP and 
5203 PLVAD), HR-PCI with IABP was associated with a higher risk of early 
mortality (OR = 1.53, 95% CI [1.21, 1.94]) and cardiogenic shock (OR = 2.56, 95% 
CI [1.98, 3.33]) when compared to PLVAD. No significant differences were found 
in the rates of arrhythmia, major bleeding, AKI, stroke/TIA, or hospital length 
of stay. Conclusions: In high-risk PCIs, PLVAD use is associated with lower 
early mortality and cardiogenic shock risk compared to IABP, with no significant 
differences in other major outcomes.

INTRODUCTION: Seralutinib is an inhaled tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting 
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) α/β, colony stimulating factor 1 
receptor (CSF1R), and mast/stem cell growth factor receptor kit (c-KIT) kinases. 
TORREY, a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 
seralutinib in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), met its primary endpoint, 
demonstrating a significant reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) 
over placebo after 24 weeks (NCT04456998; EudraCT 2019-002669-37). We present 
results (as of December 5, 2024) from an open-label extension (OLE) study 
evaluating long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of seralutinib in adults 
with PAH (NCT04816604).
METHODS: Seventy-three of 80 patients who completed TORREY (WHO Group 1 PH on 
stable PAH medications) and 1/8 patients from a phase 1b study (NCT03926793) 
enrolled in the OLE. The study design called for dosing of inhaled seralutinib 
90 mg twice daily. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were monitored. PVR 
was measured after 48 weeks (week 72 from TORREY baseline). Analyses are 
descriptive.
RESULTS: At OLE entry, 34 patients continued on seralutinib (Seralutinib 
Continued); 40 switched from placebo to seralutinib (Placebo Crossover). Common 
TEAEs were headache (28.4%), coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (27.0%), and cough 
(23.0%). TEAEs led to seralutinib discontinuation in 20 (27.0%) patients; cough 
was the reason in 9/74 (12.2%). In the Seralutinib Continued group, median 
change in PVR from TORREY baseline to weeks 24 and 72 was - 94 dyne·s/cm5 
and - 143 dyne·s/cm5, respectively (n = 28). In the Placebo Crossover group, 
corresponding values were - 32 dyne·s/cm5 and - 56 dyne·s/cm5, respectively 
(n = 27). Continued improvement in 6-min walk distance was observed. N-terminal 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) significantly decreased with 
seralutinib during TORREY and remained stable throughout the OLE. After an 
increase in TORREY, NT-proBNP levels in the Placebo Crossover group nearly 
returned to TORREY baseline at week 72.
CONCLUSIONS: These OLE data are consistent with TORREY results and support 
long-term safety and efficacy of inhaled seralutinib in patients with PAH. A 
phase 3 study of seralutinib in PAH is underway (PROSERA, NCT05934526).

that causes small blood vessels in the lungs to get thicker and stiffer, making 
it harder for the heart to pump blood to the lungs. The phase 2 TORREY study 
compared inhaled seralutinib to placebo in 86 participants, showing that 
seralutinib reduced the pressure in blood vessels in the lungs better than 
placebo. This result was enhanced in participants with more severe symptoms. 
Seralutinib also made it easier to perform everyday activities, like walking, in 
patients with more symptoms. Mild-to-moderate cough was a common side effect, 
occurring with similar frequency in seralutinib and placebo treatment groups. In 
this article, we report results of an ongoing open-label extension study in 
which 74 patients (who participated in the TORREY study or an earlier study, 
collectively called the “parent studies”) received seralutinib for an extended 
period of time. The open-label extension looked at side effects as well as 
measures of improvement such as pressure in blood vessels in the lung and 
exercise capacity (using the 6-min walk test). Seralutinib was well tolerated. 
Ongoing improvements in lung blood vessel pressure and exercise capacity were 
observed. Because of these findings, a larger phase 3 study (PROSERA, 
NCT05934526) is currently underway.

Background: Nonpharmacologic interventions have known benefits for managing 
chronic pain, particularly for conditions such as fibromyalgia, and are included 
in clinical guidelines. However, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing 
(EMDR) has not been established as a routine clinical practice for pain 
management. Objective: To systematically review the efficacy of EMDR for 
managing chronic pain. Methods: A search was conducted to identify randomized 
clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies by using the keywords "EMDR" 
and "chronic pain." Information was collected on the study population, EMDR 
protocol, methods for pain assessment, and outcomes. Risk of bias was evaluated, 
and intervention effect sizes were determined by calculating Hedges g values for 
long-term follow-up data in RCTs. Results: A total of nine studies, including 
seven RCTs, were reviewed. The studies used various diverse pain measurement 
tools and EMDR protocols. All reported significant improvements in pain symptoms 
with EMDR. Most of the studies reported statistically significant improvements 
in associated mental health issues, notably in psychological distress (four out 
of four studies), anxiety (three out of three studies), and depression (three 
out of four studies). Effect sizes varied among the studies, with three RCTs 
reporting large effects, two RCTs reporting moderate effects, and one RCT 
reporting small or nonsignificant effects. Conclusion: EMDR shows promise for 
managing chronic pain and addressing associated mental health symptoms. Despite 
study differences and limitations, the findings of this systematic review 
support the potential use of EMDR for chronic pain management.

Objective: This study examines the durability (defined as time between 
treatments) of intravenous ketamine (IV-KET) and intranasal esketamine 
(IN-ESKET) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), in a real-world clinical 
setting with repeated ketamine/esketamine maintenance therapy. Methods: This was 
a single-center, observational study of adults with TRD who completed 
acute-phase treatment between August 17, 2017, and June 24, 2021, and received 
IV-KET (0.5 mg/kg) or IN-ESK (56/84 mg) maintenance therapy. Maintenance cycle 
duration was measured from the first treatment after the acute phase to the 
final treatment. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Quick Inventory of 
Depressive Symptomatology before each treatment. Linear mixed-effects models and 
generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) evaluated treatment effects. The number 
of days between treatments (treatment intervals) was modeled using a negative 
binomial GLMM. Results: Fifty-six maintenance cycles from 38 patients were 
included. The median baseline age was 46.2 years (78.9% female). Sixty-eight 
percent (n = 26) received IV-KET, and 32% (n = 12) received IN-ESKET. The median 
duration of the longest maintenance cycle was 61 weeks for IV-KET and 48 weeks 
for IN-ESKET, with 14 and 28 median treatments, respectively. IV-KET patients 
had longer intervals between treatments compared to IN-ESKET (incidence rate 
ratio: 1.75, P < .001). Mean treatment intervals were 18.9 days for IV-KET vs 
10.8 days for IN-ESKET. Both treatments showed stable systolic blood pressure 
trajectories. Conclusion: This study provides evidence regarding longer 
durability of IV-KET compared to IN-ESKET. These findings need to be replicated 
in larger prospective studies and confirmed in a randomized controlled trial 
comparing these two treatment interventions.

BACKGROUND: The length of the tectal plate, which sits above the midbrain, is 
reduced in both the Richardson's syndrome (RS) and parkinsonism (P) variants of 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). However, it is unclear whether tectal 
measurements could be useful biomarkers in other PSP variants or predict PSP 
pathology.
METHODS: The Neurodegenerative Research Group, Mayo Clinic, enrolled 115 PSP 
(including seven variants), 19 corticobasal syndrome (CBS), 21 Parkinson's 
disease (PD), and 50 controls. Forty-seven PSP patients had PSP at autopsy, and 
15 had a non-PSP pathology. Tectal plate length and area and area of the 
superior/inferior colliculi were measured. Measurements were compared across 
clinical and pathological groups, and associations were assessed with clinical 
severity. Effect sizes were evaluated using the area under the receiver operator 
characteristic curves (AUROCs).
RESULTS: All PSP variants showed reduced tectal plate length compared to 
controls, with good differentiation (AUROC > 0.80). Excellent differentiation 
was observed for PSP-RS and PSP-P from controls (AUROC = 0.93/0.86), and PD 
(AUROC = 0.92/0.83), and PSP-RS showed good differentiation from CBS 
(AUROC = 0.80). Tectal plate and superior colliculus areas were reduced in all 
PSP variants, except PSP-Speech-language (SL), compared to controls. PSP-RS and 
PSP-P showed reduced area measurements compared to PSP-SL. No differences were 
observed between PSP and non-PSP pathology. Reduced tectal plate length was 
associated with worse clinical severity in PSP.
CONCLUSION: Tectal plate length may have utility as a disease biomarker across 
PSP variants, although tectal plate measurements could not predict pathology 
within patients clinically diagnosed with PSP.

Weight suppression, defined as the discrepancy between an individual's highest 
historical weight and their current weight, has been implicated in the 
development and maintenance of eating disorders. Although weight suppression has 
also been found to impact mood, anxiety and suicidal behavior in patients with 
and without disordered eating, it has not been examined as a transdiagnostic 
risk factor for general psychopathology. The current study examined growth 
records of 281 children and adolescents (ages 7 to 17) newly diagnosed with 
psychiatric disorders to determine whether these children were more likely to be 
weight suppressed as compared to an age- and gender-matched control group. 
Findings suggest that weight suppression is related to an increased risk for 
anxiety disorders and externalizing disorders for males. These results 
underscore the need for psychiatric and behavioral health providers to review 
pediatric growth charts as a routine part of psychiatric evaluation. As weight 
restoration is a necessary precondition for eating disorder recovery, more 
research is necessary to determine if weight restoration can enhance treatments 
for psychiatric symptoms occurring in the context of weight suppression.

The purpose of this study was to establish tentative Clinical and Laboratory 
Standards Institute (CLSI) M45 MIC and disk diffusion (DD) breakpoints (BPs) for 
Pseudomonas other than Pseudomonas aeruginosa (POPA). Mechanisms of 
antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the modified carbapenem inactivation method 
(mCIM) to detect carbapenemase production were also evaluated. MIC data from P. 
aeruginosa and POPA from 2013 to 2022 were evaluated to compare the MIC 
distributions and modal MICs relative to the CLSI M100 P. aeruginosa BPs. A 
disk-to-MIC correlation study with 83 isolates was completed by testing 
reference broth microdilution and DD from the same inoculum, and the error-rate 
bounded method was used to establish DD BPs. For most antimicrobials, the modal 
MICs between P. aeruginosa and POPA were within 1-doubling dilution and lower 
than the M100 P. aeruginosa-susceptible BP. For amikacin, the modal MIC for POPA 
was 2-doubling dilutions lower than P. aeruginosa and was evaluated relative to 
the Enterobacterales BP. For aztreonam and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, the 
modal MICs were elevated, and no BPs were set. New DD correlates were 
established for most antimicrobial agents, except for fluoroquinolones, where 
the P. aeruginosa correlates were suitable. AMR genes conferring resistance to 
multiple antimicrobial classes were identified by WGS. Beta-lactamase genes were 
identified in 30 (36.1%) isolates, with metallo-beta-lactamases (90.6%) 
predominating. The mCIM had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Upon review, 
the CLSI M45 committee proposed tentative MIC and DD BPs for expanded-spectrum 
cephalosporins (ceftazidime and cefepime), carbapenems (meropenem and imipenem), 
fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), and the aminoglycosides 
(amikacin and tobramycin).IMPORTANCEPseudomonas species other than Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa (POPA) can cause opportunistic infections which may be difficult to 
treat due to a variety of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Antimicrobial 
susceptibility testing is a critical component of patient management for these 
infections. Currently, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 
M100 non-Enterobacterales breakpoints and methodology are utilized for POPA by 
US clinical laboratories and likely do not accurately predict susceptibility 
results. The purpose of this study was to establish tentative CLSI M45 MIC and 
disk diffusion breakpoints for POPA. Mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and 
the modified carbapenem inactivation method to detect carbapenemase production 
were also evaluated. We present the data used by the volunteers tasked by CLSI 
to develop POPA breakpoints in the M45 guidelines.

Lineage switch (LS), defined as the immunophenotypic transformation of acute 
leukemia, has emerged as a mechanism of relapse after antigen-targeted 
immunotherapy, which is associated with dismal outcomes. Through an 
international collaborative effort, we identified cases of LS after a host of 
antigen-targeted therapies (eg, CD19, CD22, CD38, and CD7), described how LS was 
diagnosed, reviewed treatment approaches, and analyzed overall outcomes for this 
form of postimmunotherapy relapse. Collectively, 75 cases of LS were evaluated, 
including 53 (70.7%) cases of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) 
transforming to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 17 (22.7%) cases of B-ALL 
transforming to mixed phenotypic acute leukemia (MPAL)/acute leukemias of 
ambiguous lineage (ALAL), and 5 (6.7%) cases of rare LS presentation (ie, T-cell 
ALL to AML). An additional 10 cases with incomplete changes in immunophenotype, 
referred to as "lineage drift" were also described. With a primary focus on the 
70 cases of LS from B-ALL to AML or MPAL/ALAL, LS emerged at a median of 1.5 
months (range, 0-36.5) after immunotherapy, with 81.4% presenting with LS within 
the first 6 months from the most proximal immunotherapy. Although most involved 
KMT2A rearrangements (n = 45, 64.3%), other rare cytogenetic and/or molecular 
alterations were uniquely observed. Treatment outcomes were generally poor, with 
remission rates of <40%. The median overall survival after LS diagnosis was 4.8 
months. Outcomes were similarly poor for those with rare immunophenotypes of LS 
or lineage drift. This global initiative robustly categorizes lineage changes 
after immunotherapy and, through enhanced understanding, establishes a 
foundation for improving outcomes of LS.

Modified Proximal Gastrectomy and D2 Lymphadenectomy Is an Oncologically Sound 
Operation for Locally Advanced Proximal and GEJ Adenocarcinoma.

Siegler EL(1), Grotz TE(1).

Author information:

Background: Proximal gastrectomy (PG) with double tract reconstruction (DTR) 
offers organ preservation for early gastric cancers, leading to reduced vitamin 
B12 deficiency, less weight loss, and improved quality of life. The JCOG1401 
study confirmed excellent long-term outcomes for PG in stage I gastric cancer. 
However, in locally advanced proximal gastric cancer (LAPGC), preserving the 
gastric body and lymph node station 4d may compromise margin clearance and 
adequate lymphadenectomy. Methods: We propose a modified PG that removes the 
distal esophagus, gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), cardia, fundus, and gastric 
body, preserving only the antrum and performing DTR. Lymphadenectomy is also 
adapted, removing stations 1, 2, 3a, 4sa, 4sb, 4d, 7, 8, 9, 10 (spleen 
preserving), 11, and lower mediastinal nodes (stations 19, 20, and 110), while 
preserving stations 3b, 5, and 6. Indications for this procedure include GEJ 
(Siewert type II and III) and proximal gastric cancers with ≤2 cm distal 
esophageal involvement and ≤5 cm gastric involvement. Results: In our initial 
experience with 14 patients, we achieved R0 resection in all patients, adequate 
lymph node harvest (median 24 nodes, IQR 18-38), and no locoregional recurrences 
at a median follow-up of 18 months. We also found favorable postoperative weight 
loss, reflux, and anemia in the PG cohort. Conclusion: While larger studies and 
long-term data are still needed, our early results suggest that modified 
PG-despite sparing only the antrum-retains the key benefits of PG over total 
gastrectomy, including better weight maintenance and improved hemoglobin levels, 
while maintaining oncologic outcomes for LAPGC.

OVERVIEW: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare, 
aggressive hematologic neoplasm that involves multiple organs, including the 
skin, bone marrow and blood, lymph nodes, and central nervous system. Violaceous 
tumors or plaques appearing in sun-exposed areas are characteristic and present 
in most patients. The disease typically affects adult men aged 60-70 years, 
although children and younger adults may also be affected.
DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis is based on biopsy of an involved site and is typically 
based on the identification of blastoid cells displaying the classical 
immunophenotypes CD123, CD4, and CD56 in addition to specific pDC markers.
PROGNOSIS: The median overall survival is 18-24 months. Potential risk factors 
for shortened survival include older age, overt bone marrow involvement, and 
genetic abnormalities.
THERAPY AND MANAGEMENT: Either chemotherapy-based regimens or tagraxofusp, a 
CD123-directed interleukin 3 conjugated with diphtheria toxin, may be used for 
upfront therapy. Eligible patients are recommended to be consolidated with 
hematopoietic allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Assessment and treatment of 
the central nervous system is mandatory, and careful monitoring of skin disease 
in conjunction with dermatology is essential.

BACKGROUND: Improving efficiency of phase III trials is paramount for reducing 
costs, hastening approvals, and mitigating exposure to disadvantageous 
randomizations. Compared to standard frequentist interim analysis, Bayesian 
early stopping rules may improve efficiency by the flexibility of differential 
priors for efficacy and futility coupled with evaluation of clinically 
meaningful effect sizes.
METHODS: Individual patient-level data from 184,752 participants across 230 
randomized two-arm parallel oncology phase III trials were manually 
reconstructed from primary endpoint Kaplan-Meier curves. Accrual dynamics, but 
not patient outcomes, were randomly varied. Bayesian Cohen's κ assessed 
agreement between the original analysis and the Bayesian interim analysis.
RESULTS: Trial-level early closure was recommended based on the Bayesian interim 
analysis for 82 trials (36%), including 62 trials which had performed 
frequentist interim analysis and 33 which were already closed early by the 
frequentist interim analysis. Bayesian early stopping rules were 96% sensitive 
for detecting trials with a primary endpoint difference, and there was a high 
level of agreement in overall trial interpretation (κ, 0.95). Moreover, Bayesian 
interim analysis was associated with reduced enrollment.
CONCLUSIONS: Bayesian interim analyses seem to improve trial efficiency by 
reducing enrollment requirements without compromising interpretation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Oligometastatic prostate cancer (omPC) is 
characterized by limited metastases. We hypothesized that metastasis-directed 
therapy (MDT) to all sites of omPC combined with androgen deprivation therapy 
(ADT) would improve clinical outcomes.
METHODS: In the multicenter phase 2 EXTEND trial, patients with omPC were 
randomized 1:1 to ADT versus MDT + ADT in two independently powered and 
randomized baskets, one using intermittent ADT and one using continuous ADT. The 
primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints 
included radiologic PFS (rPFS) and castration resistance-free survival (CRFS). 
Here, the primary results of the continuous ADT basket, the combined analysis of 
both baskets, and translational immune correlatives are reported.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: From September 2018 through August 2022, 174 
patients were randomized and were eligible for the primary analysis. In the 
continuous ADT basket (N = 87), the median PFS was 47 mo with MDT + ADT versus 
22 mo with ADT (hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; one-sided p = 0.036). In the combined 
analysis, the median PFS was 36 mo with MDT + ADT versus 17 mo with ADT (HR, 
0.45; p < 0.001). Radiologic PFS and CRFS were also superior with MDT + ADT. 
Durable clinical responses after MDT + ADT were associated with systemic 
Th1-polarizing cytokine upregulation and CD8+ T-cell proliferation. Compared 
with ADT, MDT + ADT induced greater systemic immune activation, including T-cell 
receptor expansion/contraction, which we also observed in the independent ORIOLE 
trial of MDT. The greatest PFS benefit after MDT + ADT was observed in patients 
with systemic T-cell receptor expansion/contraction.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: MDT + ADT improves PFS compared with ADT 
in omPC patients, meriting phase 3 confirmation. Hypothesis-generating immune 
responses warrant mechanistic validation and future trials with T-cell-targeted 
immunotherapies.

In phase III oncology trials, superiority is defined by statistical significance 
using P thresholds. However, this approach has been criticized because P is 
continuous. Here, we reconstruct patient-level data for 230 phase III oncology 
trials to model the robustness of statistical significance by estimating the 
survival-inferred fragility index (SIFI), defined as the smallest number of 
patients changing arms that alters the statistical significance interpretation. 
The median SIFI was 8 patients (IQR 4-19), representing 1.4% of enrollments (IQR 
0.7%-3%). As a continuous statistic, P-but not the significance 
interpretation-was correlated with SIFI. Moreover, overall survival endpoints 
were more fragile than surrogate endpoints. Taken together, while phase III 
oncology trials are intended to robustly inform patient care, shifting the 
assignment of a few patients is often sufficient to upend the statistical 
significance interpretation. This vulnerability underscores the need for more 
robust strategies to identify superiority in oncology.

Tympanostomy tube placement is routinely performed in adults in the office 
setting without sedation and with only topical or locally applied anesthetic. 
Innovative tools are now available to facilitate placement of tympanostomy tubes 
in children in the office, rather than under general anesthesia. We discuss the 
current state of an in-office approach to tympanostomy tube placement in 
children. An experienced team and a well-defined workflow are key to the 
successful placement of tympanostomy tubes in children without sedation. Shared 
decision-making between clinicians and caregivers will help determine the most 
appropriate setting for their child's ear tube placement.

Accurate prognostication and personalized treatment selection remain major 
challenges in kidney cancer. This consensus initiative aimed to provide 
actionable expert guidance on the development and clinical integration of 
prognostic and predictive biomarkers and risk stratification tools to improve 
patient care and guide future research. A modified Delphi method was employed to 
develop consensus statements among a multidisciplinary panel of experts in 
urologic oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, molecular 
biology, radiology, outcomes research, biostatistics, industry, and patient 
advocacy. Over 3 rounds, including an in-person meeting 20 initial statements 
were evaluated, refined, and voted on. Consensus was defined a priori as a 
median Likert score ≥8. Nineteen final consensus statements were endorsed. These 
span key domains including biomarker prioritization (favoring prognostic 
biomarkers), rigorous methodology for subgroup and predictive analyses, the 
development of multi-institutional prospective registries, incorporation of 
biomarkers in trial design, and improvements in data/biospecimen access. The 
panel also identified high-priority biomarker types (e.g., AI-based image 
analysis, ctDNA) for future research. This is the first consensus statement 
specifically focused on biomarker and risk model development for kidney cancer 
using a structured Delphi process. The recommendations emphasize the need for 
rigorous methodology, collaborative infrastructure, prospective data collection, 
and focus on clinically translatable biomarkers. The resulting framework is 
intended to guide researchers, cooperative groups, and stakeholders in advancing 
personalized care for patients with kidney cancer.

Itaconate is an anti-inflammatory metabolite with therapeutic potential in 
multiple inflammatory diseases. However, its immunomodulatory function has been 
mainly based on ex vivo-generated macrophages or cell lines, whereas its role in 
tissue-resident macrophages is still poorly understood. Here, we report that, in 
contrast to its effects on bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), itaconate 
promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines and augments the activation 
of the NACHT-, leucine-rich-repeat- (LRR), and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 
(NLRP3) inflammasome in resident alveolar macrophages (AMs). Unlike native 
itaconate, the itaconate derivatives dimethyl itaconate (DI) and 4-octyl 
itaconate (4OI) suppress the inflammatory response in AMs. Notably, the 
intratracheal transfer of BMDMs reversed their responsiveness to itaconate, 
indicating an essential role of the alveolar microenvironment in shaping 
macrophage immunometabolism. We also demonstrate that itaconate promotes 
AM-mediated inflammatory responses in vivo and aggravates lung injury. Taken 
together, our study unexpectedly demonstrates a proinflammatory role of 
itaconate in tissue-resident AMs, suggesting that further investigations are 
needed before its clinical application.

BACKGROUND: Outcomes associated with different antithrombotic strategies after 
Amulet left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) are not well described.
OBJECTIVE: This analysis compared outcomes from patients discharged on dual 
antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) or oral 
anticoagulation (OAC) following Amulet implant in the EMERGE LAA post-approval 
study.
METHODS: Patients with a successful Amulet implant and discharged from the 
hospital between August 14, 2021 and December 15, 2023 and entered into the 
National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) LAAO Registry were included. A 
safety endpoint of all-cause death, stroke, major bleeding, or systemic embolism 
and effectiveness endpoint of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism, or 
cardiovascular death were assessed through 6 months as well as major adverse 
events.
RESULTS: A total of 11,445 patients were included in this analysis with 9355 
discharged on DAPT (81.7 %), 606 on SAPT (5.3 %), and 1484 on OAC (13.0 %). 
Patients in the SAPT group had more comorbid conditions and were at the greatest 
bleeding risk pre-Amulet implant. At 45-days, clinically relevant closure (≤3 mm 
peri-device leak) was achieved in >95 % of all patients. At 6 months, the safety 
endpoint rates were 8.8 %, 7.0 %, and 7.0 % in the DAPT, SAPT, and OAC groups, 
respectively (p = 0.045) and effectiveness endpoint rates were 2.1 %, 1.6 %, and 
1.7 % in the DAPT, SAPT, and OAC groups, respectively (p = 0.511). Despite 
higher baseline bleeding risk, the SAPT group had numerically lower bleeding 
rates than the DAPT group through 6 months (DAPT 4.8 % vs. SAPT 3.9 %; HR 1.23 
[0.78, 1.95]) with no difference in device-related thrombus rates (DAPT 0.8 % 
vs. 0.8 % SAPT; HR 0.91 [0.33, 2.50]). However, after adjusting for differences 
in baseline characteristics, no significant differences (p > 0.05) were noted 
for any clinical events between the three medication groups at 45 days or 
6 months.
CONCLUSION: In the present cohort of patients treated with Amulet LAAO there 
were high rates of LAA complete closure, and SAPT emerged as a viable 
alternative to the current DAPT regimen potentially reducing the risk of 
bleeding complications in patients at high risk without compromising 
effectiveness.

Diagnostic Utility of PRAME in Rare Melanoma Mimics: A Comparative Analysis 
Including GNET, MMNST, Epithelioid MPNST, and MITF-Rearranged Melanocytic 
Tumors.

BACKGROUND: Differentiating metastatic melanoma from histologic mimics such as 
malignant gastrointestinal neuroectodermal tumor (GNET), malignant melanotic 
nerve sheath tumor (MMNST), and epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath 
tumor (EMPNST) poses significant diagnostic challenges due to overlapping 
morphology and immunophenotypes. PRAME is a novel immunohistochemical marker 
increasingly used to distinguish melanoma from its mimics, but remains 
underexplored in these rare tumor types.
METHODS: PRAME immunohistochemistry was performed on four GNETs, seven MMNSTs, 
10 EMPNSTs, 16 metastatic melanomas (including eight undifferentiated 
melanomas), and two MITF-rearranged melanocytic tumors. PRAME expression was 
scored from 0 to 4+ based on the percentage of tumor nuclei showing moderate to 
strong staining.
RESULTS: All GNETs, MMNSTs, and MITF-rearranged tumors were PRAME-negative. 
EMPNSTs showed variable expression: six were negative (0-1), one equivocal (2+), 
and three positive (3-4+). Fifteen of 16 melanomas were PRAME-positive. PRAME 
scores differed significantly among tumor types (p = 1.99 × 10-5). PRAME 
demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing metastatic 
melanoma from primary mimickers including GNET and MMNST, but low specificity in 
EMPNST (71.4%).
CONCLUSIONS: PRAME reliably distinguishes metastatic melanoma from GNET and 
MMNST, supporting its use in this differential. However, its reduced specificity 
in EMPNST limits its standalone diagnostic value in this context, emphasizing 
the need for a multimodal approach.

BACKGROUND: Surgeons often recommend weight loss for patients with obesity 
before total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, it is unknown whether 
preoperative weight loss affects outcomes. The goals of this study were to 
determine how many patients with obesity lost weight before TKA, to identify 
weight loss predictors, and to evaluate if preoperative weight loss affected 
postoperative outcomes.
METHODS: Among 23,726 primary TKAs performed between 2002 and 2019, we 
identified 3,665 patients who had a body mass index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m2 measured 
1 to 24 months before surgery and had a weight measured at surgery. The mean 
patient age was 68 years, and 59% of patients were female. The mean patient BMI 
was 36 kg/m2. Univariable linear regressions evaluated weight loss predictors. 
Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions and Cox proportional hazards 
models evaluated the impact of preoperative weight change on discharge, 
operative time, periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs), complications, 
revisions, and reoperations. The mean follow-up was 6 years.
RESULTS: Overall, 20% of patients gained ≥5 pounds (1 pound = 0.45 kg), 39% 
maintained weight, 17% lost 5 to <10 pounds, 15% lost 10 to <20 pounds, and 9% 
lost ≥20 pounds before TKA. Male patients lost slightly more weight (-4.6 
pounds) than female patients (-4.3 pounds) (p = 0.05). In univariable analyses, 
gaining >5 pounds was associated with increased odds of extended hospital length 
of stay (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; p = 0.01) and risk of complications (hazard ratio 
[HR], 1.7; p < 0.01). Losing 10 to <20 pounds was associated with increased 
risks of revision (HR, 2.0; p = 0.01), PJI (HR, 3.1; p < 0.01), and 
complications (HR, 1.6; p = 0.03). In multivariable analyses, compared with 
maintaining weight, losing 10 to <20 pounds was associated with an increased 
risk of PJI (HR, 2.6; p = 0.01), whereas gaining >5 pounds was associated with 
an increased risk of complications (HR, 1.5; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Few patients with obesity lost substantial weight before primary 
TKA, and reaching common preoperative weight loss goals was not associated with 
improved outcomes. Although a healthy weight is important for general health, 
weight loss before TKA may not be sufficient to improve postoperative outcomes 
for most patients with obesity.

OBJECTIVE: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is characterized by high stress 
sensitivity and unsatisfactory response rates to standard treatments. Stress and 
depression share a bidirectional relationship. We, therefore, conducted a pilot 
randomized control trial (RCT) to understand if adjunctive stress management and 
resiliency training tailored for depression(SMART-D), can improve treatment 
outcomes in patients with MDD, receiving treatment as usual(TAU) with standard 
treatments (medications and/or psychotherapy), in real-world clinical settings, 
compared to a group receiving TAU.
METHODS: Participants with MDD, in a current depressive episode, were randomized 
to adjunctive SMART-D (delivered by video telehealth over 8 weeks), compared to 
TAU alone. Random assignment, blinding of raters and statistician were utilized. 
The primary outcome measure was baseline to end point change in depression 
[Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D] over a 6-month follow-up period 
using a mixed model regression analysis.
RESULTS: 27 participants (mean age 47.9 ± 14 years, female 67%) enrolled in the 
study (TAU = 14, SMART-D + TAU = 13). Baseline mood ratings were in 
mild-moderate symptom severity (HAM-D)- SMART-D + TAU = 12.2 ± 6.6, 
TAU = 13.9 ± 5.7). Linear mixed model analysis showed significant Group*Time 
interaction for measures of depression (HAM-D) (B = 6.1 (CI = 1.5-10.8, P = .01) 
and perceived stress (PSS) (B = 5.5(0.5-10.6), p = .03) between the 2 groups at 
3 months post follow-up ((HAMD)-SMART-D + TAU = 8.7 ± 4.3 Vs. TAU = 16.1 ± 6.3), 
but not at 6-months (SMART-D + TAU = 8.1 ± 5.4 Vs. TAU = 12.3 ± 5.5).
CONCLUSIONS: A RCT of 27 adults with MDD provide initial support that an 
adjunctive resiliency intervention (SMART-D) for patients with MDD may 
positively impact symptoms of depression and perceived stress, earlier than 
standard care. A small sample size limits ability to draw firm conclusions. 
Further investigation is warranted, using larger samples. Clinical Trials

The liver stores substantial numbers of neutral lipid organelles termed lipid 
droplets (LDs) that accumulate within hepatocytes in response to chronic ethanol 
(EtOH) consumption leading to hepatic steatosis. Mass spectrometry analysis of 
LDs isolated from EtOH-damaged rat livers revealed a substantial reduction in 
the valosin-containing protein ATPase (VCP/p97) that acts to remove targeted 
proteins from cellular membranes for degradation. Experimental disruption of VCP 
function resulted in an increase in LD content in hepatocytes and mouse livers 
along with a marked increase in LD-associated hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 
(HSD17β13) known to contribute to hepatic steatosis. Surprisingly, treatment of 
hepatocytes with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 had no effect on HSD17β13 
levels, while a disruption of lysosome function and chaperone-mediated autophagy 
increased cellular HSD17β13 levels substantially. These findings provide new 
insights into the cellular mechanisms by which the liver regulates its lipid 
stores and how this is disrupted by chronic EtOH exposure.

Post-Operative Bleed Risks Associated with Perioperative Nonsteroidal 
Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: A Narrative Review.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used medications that 
function by inhibiting cyclooxygenase enzymes. Although they are highly 
effective in managing pain and inflammation, their potential for increasing 
bleeding risks continues to be a concern. Due to the increased risk for bleeding 
complications following surgical procedures, the safety of perioperative NSAIDs 
is debated. The primary objective of this article is to examine literature 
published in the past 10 years focused on post-operative bleeding risks 
associated with perioperative NSAID use. A systematic search was designed to 
include randomized controlled trials, systematic review meta-analyses, and 
retrospective or prospective reviews examining post-operative bleeding events 
associated with perioperative NSAID use in adults. Following the screening 
process and review, 11 articles were included. The reviewed literature primarily 
examines post-operative bleeding incidence, blood loss, hemoglobin decline, and 
the frequency of hematomas or hemorrhages. Overall, the evidence suggests that 
perioperative NSAIDs have minimal impact on post-operative bleeding risk. COX-2 
selective NSAIDs may be a safer alternative to nonselective NSAIDs, with some 
studies indicating a lower risk of post-operative bleeding following their use. 
Ultimately, the decision to use NSAIDs in the perioperative period should be 
tailored to the specific surgical procedure and individual patient factors.

Drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis represents a distinct phenotype of 
drug-induced liver injury characterized by clinical, biochemical, and/or 
histological features resembling autoimmune hepatitis. We present a case of 
severe Isoniazid (INH) -induced drug-induced autoimmune-like hepatitis in a 
62-year-old man with a dramatic response to corticosteroid therapy after INH 
discontinuation alone proved insufficient. Initial laboratory tests showed 
markedly elevated transaminases and profound hyperbilirubinemia. Despite INH 
discontinuation, his clinical condition did not improve. Liver biopsy revealed 
severe acute hepatitis with interface hepatitis, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, 
and multiple foci of lobular confluent necrosis. Prednisone therapy led to rapid 
clinical improvement and normalization of liver biochemistries over 3 months.

OBJECTIVE: Patients with cricopharyngeus muscle dysfunction (CPMD) with and 
without diverticula (e.g., Zenker Diverticulum) often struggle with dysphagia 
for years prior to diagnosis or intervention. Surgical treatment is successful; 
yet, there is limited long-term data on dysphagia outcomes after surgery.
METHODS: Individuals prospectively enrolled in the Prospective Outcomes of 
Cricopharyngeal Hypertonicity (POuCH) collaborative with and without diverticula 
who underwent surgery from November 2014 to August 2024 and had at least 
12 months of follow-up were included. Eating Assessment Tool 10 (EAT10) was used 
to characterize patient-reported outcomes. Descriptive statistics were performed 
using means, frequencies, and spaghetti plots.
RESULTS: Of 164 patients initially identified, 2 withdrew and 2 were excluded 
for incomplete data; 160 were included. 31% were women, with a mean (SD) age of 
70.1 (11.5). Endoscopic surgery (113, 71%) was more common than open technique 
(47, 29%). 19.4% of patients had undergone previous surgery. Postoperatively, 
patients were found to have improved EAT-10 scores, with smaller changes 
recorded after 36 months. Median change in EAT-10 compared to preoperative score 
was -12 points [IQR: -18, -5] at 12 months. 39 (24%) patients were followed for 
> 24 months (median change -11 [IQR: -14, -7]); 26 (16%) > 36 months (-9.5 [-17, 
-5]), and 12 (7.5%) > 48 months (-4 [IQR: -18, 4]). Six patients died during the 
study period.
CONCLUSION: Improved dysphagia after surgery appears stable with minimal change 
over time. Most patients (96.3%) survive at least 1 year. Surgical intervention 
for patients with CPMD with or without diverticula is an effective and reliable 
treatment option.

BACKGROUND: Decision aids (DAs) may increase engagement in decision-making by 
addressing barriers that disproportionately impact socioeconomically 
disadvantaged patients. The impact of a breast cancer surgery DA on increasing 
patient engagement in decision-making was tested in clinics serving a high 
proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged patients.
METHODS: A stepped-wedge trial was conducted with 10 National Cancer Institute 
Community Oncology Research Program clinics (Alliance for Clinical Trials in 
Oncology, June 2019 to December 2021). The clinics were randomized to time of 
transition from usual care (UC) to delivery of a web-based DA. Patients with 
stages 0-3 breast cancer eligible for surgery provided consent before a surgical 
consultation. Engagement was measured by Patient's Self-Efficacy in 
Patient-Physician Interactions (PEPPI-5, follow-up survey) and count of Active 
Patient Behaviors (audio-recorded consultation). Intervention effects were 
tested with linear mixed-effects models, accounting for surgeon and clinic-level 
clustering, time, and enrollment after COVID. Heterogeneity of treatment effect 
by socioeconomic disadvantage (using the Area Deprivation Index) was assessed 
with an interaction term.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 576 patients, and 44 % (136/309) of the patients 
reviewed the DA. No significant difference in engagement was observed between DA 
and UC for PEPPI-5 (- 0.8; 95 % CI, - 2.1-0.6; p = 0.260) or Active Patient 
Behaviors (2.5; 95 % CI, - 4.1-9.2; p = 0.456). No heterogeneity of treatment 
effect was observed. Socioeconomic disadvantage was associated with fewer Active 
Patient Behaviors (- 5.9; 95 % CI, - 0.6-- 1.2; p = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: This trial conducted in clinics that serve diverse populations, 
observed no significant relationship between a web-based DA and patient 
engagement. Future analyses will explore DA implementation, characteristics of 
patients who reviewed the DA, and persistent barriers to engagement.

INTRODUCTION: Delays in time to surgery (TTS) for patients with a hip fracture 
negatively affect patient outcomes, including mortality. Surgery within 24 to 48 
hours of admission for a hip fracture markedly reduces these risks; however, 
attempts at improving TTS after hip fracture have had mixed results. Drivers of 
delays in TTS across different settings in the United States are not well 
described. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify drivers of delays in 
TTS for patients with a hip fracture from different settings to inform where 
patient- and context-specific improvements in TTS may be implemented.
METHODS: Semistructured interviews were completed using the Consolidated 
Framework for Implementation Research and Theoretical Domains Framework. 
Interviews were completed with stakeholders involved in hip fracture care 
between June 2023 and October 2023. Transcripts were analyzed iteratively 
through a combined inductive and deductive approach. The data were analyzed to 
synthesize overarching themes related to drivers of delays of TTS.
RESULTS: A total of 25 stakeholders, 24 orthopaedic surgeons, and 1 nurse 
practitioner, from 22 different hospital systems across the United States 
participated in semistructured interviews. Eight themes of drivers of delayed 
TTS emerged: (1) patient health; (2) structural drivers of health; (3) care 
coordination; (4) prioritization; (5) improvement climate; (6) availability; (7) 
incentive structure; and (8) empowerment.
CONCLUSION: Eight major themes related to drivers in TTS for patients with a hip 
fracture were identified across hospital systems. These findings inform the 
process of identifying site-specific drivers of delayed TTS at individual health 
systems and implementing targeted improvement programs for TTS for patients with 
a hip fracture.

PURPOSE: To assess associations of 3D morphometry of breast calcifications, 
determined using high-resolution microCT, with underlying histopathology and 
evaluate the potential for classifying tissue calcifications as an aid in 
optimizing identification and diagnosis of the most severe pathology in a 
biopsy.
METHODS: We compared morphometry of calcifications in tissue blocks (n = 156) of 
benign breast disease (n = 74), ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 39), and ductal 
carcinoma in situ with invasive breast cancer (n = 43) using (10 µm) microCT. 
Matched sections were reviewed microscopically to define lesion(s) in which 
calcifications were embedded. 3D reconstructions of calcifications were reviewed 
independently by two masked radiologists to assess the need for biopsy and 
calcification morphology. Calcification morphometry was compared to pathologic 
diagnosis using linear mixed models.
RESULTS: A total of 12,216 calcifications (IQR 9-66 per specimen) were analyzed. 
Individual breast cancer-associated calcifications were significantly larger 
than benign breast disease-associated calcifications (padjusted = 0.012) and 
calcification volume was positively associated with grade of ductal carcinoma in 
situ (Ptrend = 0.009). Structure model index revealed more cylindrical shape in 
breast cancer calcifications versus benign breast disease calcifications 
(padjusted = 0.008). Re-analysis by the specific microscopic lesion containing 
the calcification, rather than the most severe diagnosis per biopsy, 
strengthened associations. Radiologists agreed on biopsy recommendation in 92% 
of microCT images, while achieving sensitivities of 53.1% and 54.3%. and 
specificities of 50.0% and 54.1%.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides proof-of-concept that morphometry of tissue 
calcifications varies by lesion type, suggesting that future studies may enable 
development of a pathologic classification linked to diagnosis and mammographic 
findings.

BACKGROUND: The association between transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic 
shunt TIPS and waitlist outcomes in simultaneous liver-kidney (SLK) transplant 
recipients remains unclear.
METHODS: Between 2003 and 2023, we examined the scientific registry of 
transplant recipients. All adult candidates with overlapping waiting lists for 
liver and kidney transplants (N = 15 087) were analyzed (entire cohort). 
Candidates without TIPS (n = 13 980) and with (n = 1107) were followed through 
November 30, 2023, and the following outcomes were analyzed: death, SLK 
transplant, liver- or kidney-alone transplant, or removal from the list. The 
Aalen-Johansen method was used to calculate the cumulative incidence rates of 
the outcomes, where the outcomes were considered competing risks. Mixed effects 
Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the outcomes by TIPS status. 
We separately analyzed dialysis-dependent candidates (n = 10 370).
RESULTS: In the entire cohort, the 1-year cumulative incidence of death in those 
without TIPS was higher than in those with (12.5% vs. 9%). In the 
dialysis-dependent cohort, the 1-year death incidence was 13.3% versus 8.8% in 
those without TIPS and those with, respectively. In the multivariable Cox 
proportional hazard models, TIPS was associated with a 29% lower mortality risk 
in the entire cohort (HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.60-0.84, p < 0.001) and a 33% lower 
risk of mortality in the dialysis-dependent cohort. The likelihood of receiving 
SLK was lower for recipients with TIPS in the univariable analysis. However, 
this association was attenuated after adjustment. The causes of removal were 
similar irrespective of TIPS status in both cohorts.
CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of SLK candidates, those with TIPS had a better 
waitlist survival, irrespective of their dialysis requirements before 
transplantation. Prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.

Conventional Computed Tomography (CCT) measures the total x-ray attenuation for 
a whole x-ray spectrum, which can be used for medical diagnosis of anatomically 
visible pathologies. Spectral Computed Tomography (SCT) is an extension of CCT 
and enables the separation of two distinct processes of x-ray attenuation in 
tissues. The combined pair of attenuation contributions is material-specific, 
enabling rapid quantification of in vivo tissue composition. The combined, 
detailed knowledge about anatomy and pathological tissue composition allows for 
disease phenotyping, with great potential for improved medical diagnosis. In 
this paper we introduce X-Ray Attenuation Decomposition (XAD), to intuitively 
display and quantify the material contents of biological tissues and integrate 
it into the conventional, anatomical visualization of CT images. XAD gives an 
interactive display of material contents superimposed on anatomical information, 
making it easy to identify both the anatomical location as well as the 
concentrations of specific materials.

Disposition index (DI), defined as the product of insulin sensitivity and β-cell 
responsivity, is the best measure of β-cell function. This is usually assessed 
from plasma glucose and insulin, and sometimes C-peptide, data either from 
surrogate indices or model-based methods. However, the recent advent of 
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems in non-insulin-treated individuals 
raises the possibility of its quantification in outpatients. As a first step, we 
propose a method to assess DI from glucose concentration data only and validated 
it against the oral minimal model (OMM). To do so, we used data from two 
clinical dataset with mixed meal tolerance test (MTT) studies in 
non-insulin-treated individuals: the first consisted of 14 individuals with type 
2 diabetes studied twice, either after receiving a DPP-4 inhibitor or a placebo 
before the meal, whereas the second consisted of 62 individuals with and without 
pre- or type 2 diabetes. A third, simulated, dataset consisted of 100 virtual 
subjects from the Padova Type 2 Diabetes Simulator was used for additional 
tests. Plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations were used to 
estimate the reference DI from the OMM (DIMM), whereas glucose data only were 
used to calculate the proposed DI (DIG). DIG was well correlated with DIMM in 
both the clinical and simulated datasets (R between 0.88 and 0.79, P < 0.001), 
and exhibited the same between-visit or between-group pattern. DIG can be used 
to assess therapy effectiveness and degree of glucose tolerance using glucose 
data only, paving the way to potentially assess β-cell function in real-life 
conditions using CGM.NEW & NOTEWORTHY The advent of continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM) in non-insulin-treated individuals raises the possibility of 
quantifying disposition index (DI), a key metric of β-cell function usually 
assessed in research settings, in outpatients. A method for DI estimation from 
postprandial glucose data only (DIG) was developed and validated against a 
reference. DIG can be used to assess therapy effectiveness and degree of glucose 
tolerance in non-insulin-treated individuals, paving the way for its 
quantification in real-life conditions from CGM devices.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of preoperative cardiac status and tumor 
characteristics with long-term survival after valve surgery for carcinoid heart 
disease (CHD).
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of patients surgically treated for 
CHD at our institution between 2000 and 2023.
RESULTS: A total of 168 patients (median age, 63.2 years; 48.2% women) with CHD 
who underwent valvular surgery from 2000 to 2023 were included. The primary site 
of the neuroendocrine tumor was the small bowel in 89.3% of the patients. All 
patients had liver metastasis, with 31% of the patients having more than 75% 
involvement of the liver parenchyma, and 28% had bone metastases. Tricuspid 
valve replacement was performed in 98.2%, pulmonary valve replacement in 79.2%, 
and both in 78.6%. Operative mortality was 6%. After a median follow-up of 8.3 
years, median survival was 2.9 (2.2 to 4.1) years (5-year survival was 34.1% for 
the overall cohort, 16.2% for patients with more than 75% liver metastasis, and 
13.1% for those with bone metastases). Independent predictors of long-term 
mortality included more than 75% metastatic liver involvement (hazard ratio 
[HR], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1 to 2.3), presence of bone metastases (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 
1.2 to 3.0), New York Heart Association class III or IV (HR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.5 to 
3.6), and severe right ventricular dysfunction (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.6).
CONCLUSION: Valve surgery in patients with CHD relieves symptoms of right-sided 
heart failure. However, long-term survival is limited in patients with 
significant metastatic liver burden, bone metastases, or severe right 
ventricular dysfunction, underscoring the importance of incorporating these 
prognostic factors into preoperative risk assessment.

BACKGROUND: This study sought to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes of 
aortic valve (AV) intervention by decalcification or replacement for the 
treatment of mild to moderate calcific AV stenosis (AS) in patients undergoing 
transaortic septal myectomy for subaortic left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) 
obstruction.
METHODS: Between 2000 and 2023, study investigators identified 137 consecutive 
patients undergoing myectomy with or without membranectomy for mild to moderate 
calcific AS. Of these patients, 93 underwent surgical intervention on the AV and 
formed the primary cohort; 44 patients who did not undergo AV intervention were 
used as a control group. Subaortic LVOT obstruction was the primary indication 
for surgery.
RESULTS: The median age of patients with AV intervention was 71.3 years (range, 
66.5-76.9 years), and 50.5% of the patients were female. Forty-four patients 
(47.3%) underwent AV decalcification, whereas 49 (52.7%) had AV replacement, 
with no significant differences in clinical features. Valvular cusp 
calcification was less extensive in the decalcification group (P < .001). Early 
postoperatively, AV gradients improved in both groups (each P < .001) to similar 
extents. No patients in the decalcification group experienced severe AV 
regurgitation. Rates of AV reintervention were similar between groups (P = .84) 
and were lower than in the control group. Long-term survival was comparable 
between both groups and matched patients who underwent isolated myectomy without 
AV disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Mild to moderate AS may complicate operative treatment of subaortic 
LVOT obstruction in adults. When surgical management is guided by visual 
determination of the extent of cusp calcification, AV decalcification yields 
good early hemodynamic results and late survival and reoperation rates similar 
to AV replacement.

OBJECTIVES: Surgical septal reduction is sometimes avoided in older adults due 
to anticipated high operative risk. The study objectives were to compare the 
clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of young and older patients 
undergoing septal myectomy for obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 
assess differences in early and late postoperative outcomes.
METHODS: A total of 2663 patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
underwent transaortic septal myectomy between 2000 and 2021 and were categorized 
by age: 18 to 64 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 years or more.
RESULTS: Median age at the time of surgery increased over the study interval. 
Female sex (P < .001), hypertension P < .001), and diabetes (P = .004) were more 
prevalent in older patients, but extent of functional limitation (New York Heart 
Association) was similar (P = .092). Elderly patients had thinner septal and 
posterior walls (P < .001, P = .006) and less prominent asymmetry (P < .001). 
They are less likely to have positive genetic testing. Hospital mortality was 
0.2%, 0.5%, and 1.3% in patients aged less than 65 years, 65 to 74 years, and 75 
years or more, respectively (P = .06), and 5-year survivals were 97%, 93%, and 
91%, respectively. Septal-to-posterior wall thickness ratio significantly 
correlated with increased mortality in patients aged more than 65 years, but not 
in patients aged less than 65 years (P = .92). Most of the patients reported 
improved quality of life after myectomy.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical characteristics of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
in older patients differ from those in younger patients. More symmetric but less 
extensive ventricular hypertrophy and less positive genetic testing suggests 
that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has distinct clinical and morphological 
variants in the elderly. Septal myectomy is safe in older patients, but the 
presence of left ventricular wall asymmetry portends a poorer prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The diffusion tensor imaging along perivascular spaces index 
(DTI-ALPS), which measures diffusivity in the perivascular spaces along the 
medullary veins, has gained popularity and controversy as a surrogate marker of 
glymphatic clearance. The goal of this work is to automatically estimate 
DTI-ALPS in a large population-based sample, evaluate the correlates of the 
signal observed in the context of aging and dementia biomarkers, and evaluate 
its clinical usefulness.
METHODS: We identified 2715 participants aged 30 + years in the population-based 
Mayo Clinic Study of Aging with diffusion MRI. We calculated DTI-ALPS through a 
modified pipeline of previously published methods. We evaluated DTI-ALPS using 
different protocols and scanners and reported ICC for agreement. We examined the 
predictors of longitudinal DTI-ALPS with demographics (age, sex), vascular risk, 
clinical data (diagnosis, global cognition), and imaging markers (white matter 
hyperintensity (WMH), global amyloid load from PIB-PET, and temporal meta-ROI 
Tau-PET SUVR) in a subset of participants aged 50 + years using Pearson 
correlations, ANCOVA with adjustments for age and sex, and linear mixed effect 
models. We also compared the utility of DTI-ALPS with WMH for prediction of 
cognitive decline.
RESULTS: With modifications to the automated DTI-ALPS pipeline, consistent 
measurements can be made from data obtained with different protocols on 
different scanners. DTI-ALPS was negatively correlated with age, vascular risk, 
and WMH burden and was positively correlated with cognitive scores and higher in 
females. In the longitudinal models, WMH explained the greatest variability in 
decline of DTI-ALPS. The age and sex adjusted associations with AD biomarkers 
(amyloid and tau) were minimal. DTI-ALPS had a significant interaction with WMH 
on the rate of cognitive decline.
CONCLUSIONS: DTI-ALPS can be reliably automated in large samples. The computed 
DTI-ALPS was associated with vascular dysfunction (vascular risk and WMH) and 
may provide additional complementary information about cognitive decline. The 
low associations with AD biomarkers suggest that DTI-ALPS may be a poor 
surrogate of AD.

BACKGROUND: Progressive apraxia of speech (PAOS) is a neurodegenerative disorder 
most commonly arising from a 4-repeat tauopathy that affects the programming or 
planning of speech, although many patients develop a Parkinson-plus syndrome. 
The role of neuroinflammation as a disease mechanism is unknown. We investigated 
the spatial pattern of neuroinflammation in PAOS using PET and evaluated whether 
it is associated with disease severity, presence of Parkinson-plus features, and 
tau PET uptake.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five PAOS patients (13 with Parkinson-plus 
features) and 30 controls underwent inflammatory 11C-ER176 and tau 
18F-flortaucipir PET scans as well as detailed clinical assessments. Multiple 
linear regression analyses compared the inflammatory standardized uptake value 
ratio (SUVR) between PAOS and controls and assessed the relationship with 
clinical test scores. Pearson correlation analysis examined the relationship 
between inflammatory and tau SUVRs.
RESULTS: PAOS had greater neuroinflammatory SUVR than controls in the 
precentral, supplementary motor area, frontal gyri, putamen, pallidum, 
subthalamic nucleus, and red nucleus (adjusted P < 0.05). Greater 
neuroinflammation was associated with worse parkinsonism, and patients who had 
developed Parkinson-plus features showed a broader pattern of neuroinflammation, 
extending to prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortices. Neuroinflammation 
correlated with tau uptake in most (96%) PAOS patients (r > 0.3, P < 0.05). The 
higher correlation was associated with worse parkinsonism (r = 0.61, P < 0.05) 
and disease severity (r = 0.54, P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: 11C-ER176 PET analysis demonstrates neuroinflammation in frontal 
and subcortical regions in PAOS which is particularly severe and widespread with 
the development of Parkinson-plus clinical features. The colocalization of 
neuroinflammation and tau may support a relationship between these disease 
mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: The utility of vasopressin as an adjunctive, catecholamine-sparing 
vasopressor in cardiogenic shock (CS) has not been widely examined.
METHODS: We included consecutive adult patients admitted with a diagnosis of CS 
requiring vasopressors. High-dose vasopressors (HDV) were defined as ≥0.3 
mcg/kg/min of norepinephrine equivalent. Multivariable logistic regression and 
propensity analysis was used to calculate odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence 
interval (CI) values for in-hospital mortality, before and after adjustment for 
relevant covariates.
RESULTS: We included 721 CS patients, including HDV in 32.5%. Vasopressin was 
administered in 207 (29%) patients within the first 24 hours. In-hospital 
mortality occurred in 38.1% and was higher in the HDV group (56.8% vs 29.2%). 
Vasopressin was associated with lower propensity adjusted in-hospital mortality 
(adjusted OR 0.59, 95% CI, 0.35-0.99, P = .05). Vasopressin use was also 
associated with lower mortality in the HDV group (unadjusted OR 0.54, 95% CI, 
0.32-0.92, P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Vasopressin use in the first 24 hours was associated with lower 
adjusted mortality in patients with CS, particularly amongst those requiring 
HDV. The use of vasopressin in CS merits dedicated prospective evaluation.

BACKGROUND: We present a novel microsurgical model to investigate 
ischemia-reperfusion injury in composite tissue (muscle/skin) using a 
musculocutaneous flap. Ischemia-reperfusion was induced in a rodent biceps 
femoris musculocutaneous flap through collateral ligation and arteriovenous 
clamping. We hypothesized that ischemia-reperfusion flaps would show greater 
tissue damage compared to sham.
METHODS: Male rats were randomized into ischemia-reperfusion (N=10) and sham 
(N=9) groups. The ischemia-reperfusion group underwent flap elevation, 
collateral ligation, 3-hours of arteriovenous clamping, and followed by 
reperfusion. Sham had flap elevation only. Perfusion was monitored using 
laser-speckle imaging, and flap discoloration was assessed with blinded-SKIN 
scores. Serum and the composite tissue (skin/muscle) were analyzed for injury on 
postoperative days (POD) 1 or 3.
RESULTS: Clamping reduced perfusion (p=0.00), while unclamping increased 
perfusion (p<0.00). Over time, flaps exposed to ischemia-reperfusion were more 
ischemic (Estimate 0.39, p=0.02). At POD1, the injury group had higher serum 
creatine kinase (p=0.04) and potassium (p=0.00) than sham. The injury group had 
more muscle apoptosis (34.7% vs. 5.2%, p=0.03), myonecrosis (30.3% vs. 14.1%, 
p=0.04), and inflammation (13.7% vs. 4.9%, p=0.02) than sham; myonecrosis and 
inflammation persisted into POD3. Skin apoptosis and inflammation were similar.
CONCLUSIONS: This model reliably reproduces ischemia-reperfusion injury with a 
3-hour ischemic period followed by early reperfusion. Animals subjected to our 
technique showed greater tissue damage than sham, with muscle being more 
vulnerable than skin. Serum showed peak muscle injury at 24-hours, and histology 
showed myonecrosis and inflammation through 72-hours. This suggests that 
<24-hours reperfusion (e.g., critical-window) may serve as the optimal time for 
possible intervention.

INTRODUCTION: Acoustic analysis of speech has discriminated decompensated acute 
heart failure (HF). Speech rate (SR) and cepstral peak prominence (CPP) 
variation are among features previously evaluated. However, the association 
between SR and CPP and chronic stable HF with and without pulmonary hypertension 
(PH) as well as PH alone have not been previously studied.
METHODS: Patients evaluated for HF and/or PH in the outpatient setting recorded 
a standardized text read out loud from which a sentence was extracted and 
analysed to extract pre-specified acoustic features including SR and CPP 
calculated for voiced speech (CPP-V) and in all speech (CPP-All). Patients were 
grouped depending on the presence or absence of disease (HF and/or PH) and 
symptoms. Linear regression models were fitted to determine the association 
between each acoustic feature and disease status.
RESULTS: In total, 2153 patients were included: age 65.32 ± 17.18 years; male 
n = 1246 (57.9%); 879 had HF (40.8%), 542 had PH (25.2%) and 777 had no disease 
and no symptoms (36.1%). After adjustment for age and sex, SR was significantly 
lower in patients with PH only [estimated coefficient, 95% confidence interval 
(CI): -0.14, -0.21 to -0.06, P = 0.0006], HF only (-0.11, -0.17 to -0.05, 
P = 0.0002) and HF with PH (-0.17, -0.24 to -0.10, P < 0.0001) compared with no 
disease. CPP-V differed in patients with PH only (0.37, 0.16-0.57, P = 0.0004) 
and CPP-All differed significantly compared with patients without disease (0.23, 
0.08-0.38, P = 0.0025).
CONCLUSIONS: SR is significantly slower in patients with HF alone, PH alone and 
HF and PH combined compared with patients without disease. CPP also differs 
significantly in patients with PH compared with controls. These findings suggest 
that acoustic analysis may be useful in discriminating chronic stable HF and PH, 
offering promise for the development of non-invasive screening methods for HF 
and PH.

BACKGROUND: Various techniques exist to decrease the false negative rate (FNR) 
of axillary surgical staging post neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). While 
biopsy-proven positive lymph nodes (LNs) are often clipped prior to NAC, the 
value of clipped node localization is debated.
METHODS: We identified cT0-4c biopsy-proven cN+ breast cancer patients with a 
clipped LN treated with NAC and definitive surgery (September 2016-July 2024). 
The axillary staging procedure included sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery or 
targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Frequency of the clipped node being an SLN 
and FNR of the clipped node versus all nodes removed during SLN surgery/TAD were 
determined.
RESULTS: Of 540 patients with 541 cN+ breasts with cancer, 456 patients had a 
positive LN clipped prior to NAC and underwent axillary surgical staging (404 
TAD, 52 SLN surgery). The clipped node was retrieved in 93% of eligible patients 
(96% TAD vs. 77% SLN surgery; p < 0.001) and, if retrieved, was an SLN in 86% 
(85% TAD vs. 92.5% SLN surgery; p = 0.20). The median number of nodes retrieved 
was four for both SLN surgery and TAD. Among 204 patients with ypN+ disease who 
had the clipped node and additional non-clipped nodes removed, FNR of the 
clipped node was 5.4%, and FNR of the SLNs was 4.9%.
CONCLUSION: In a contemporary NAC cohort of cN+ patients, the clipped node was 
retrieved and was a SLN in most cases. When compared with all nodes removed 
during SLN surgery/TAD, the clipped node FNR was low, thus supporting the 
potential for limitation of axillary staging surgery to selective removal of the 
clipped node alone.

Pelvicalyceal invasion (PCI) is a relatively novel pT3a staging parameter for 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) nephrectomies. While interobserver reproducibility 
staging studies of sinus/vascular invasion in RCC exist, a similar evaluation 
for PCI has not been performed. Moreover, in our experience, there is also 
diagnostic variability in how pathologists interpret PCI. Herein, we explore 
interobserver reproducibility among genitourinary (GU) pathologists. Twenty 
hematoxylin and eosin-stained digitized slides from RCCs (all grossly 
approaching the renal pelvis) were distributed to 31 GU pathologists to classify 
each as PCI or not PCI based on their respective clinical practices; slides with 
concomitant sinus/fat/vascular invasion were excluded. Slides were then 
evaluated for the following 4 morphologic features: tumor abutting renal pelvis, 
tumor pushing/indenting into the renal pelvis, polypoid configuration of tumor 
into the renal pelvis, and tumor eroding through renal pelvic urothelium. 
Interobserver reproducibility was assessed, and the morphologic features were 
correlated with PCI. Relationships between pathologists' interpretations, 
morphologic features, and PCI were evaluated using hierarchical clustering. 
Although the diagnosis of PCI was relatively uniform with a majority agreement 
(>67%) reached in 16/20 slides, overall interobserver reproducibility was only 
moderate (kappa=0.601). While all 4 morphologic features were sensitive for PCI, 
polypoid configuration of the tumor into the renal pelvis and the tumor eroding 
through the renal pelvic urothelium were most specific (90%, 100%, 
respectively). Although we show general consensus among genitourinary 
pathologists on PCI assessment, clarifying the diagnostic guidelines with 
specific criteria should be included in pathologic staging systems.

OBJECTIVE: Benign adrenocortical adenomas are frequently diagnosed on 
cross-sectional imaging performed for unrelated reasons. Up to 15% to 20% of 
adrenal nodules are bilateral, representing bilateral adenomas or primary 
bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia.
METHODS: Mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS), diagnosed based on an 
abnormal dexamethasone suppression test, is seen in 19% to 44% of patients with 
adrenal adenomas. Distinguishing unilateral from bilateral MACS in patients with 
bilateral nodules is important to guide appropriate therapy and relies on 
imaging phenotype, and, in some cases, on adrenal vein sampling.
RESULTS: MACS is associated with cardiovascular morbidity, poor quality of life, 
frailty, and increased mortality. Reversal of MACS improves these outcomes; 
however, management of patients with bilateral MACS is challenging. Unilateral 
adrenalectomy in patients with bilateral nodules and MACS may lead to permanent 
remission (if MACS is unilateral), temporary remission, or improvement of the 
degree of MACS (if MACS is bilateral). No medical therapy is currently approved 
for MACS.
CONCLUSION: Here, we review the presentation, diagnosis, and management of 
patients with bilateral adrenal nodules and MACS.

INTRODUCTION: Endogenous Cushing's syndrome (CS) is a rare endocrine disorder 
that chronically exposes patients to supraphysiological cortisol levels. Primary 
therapy for CS consists of surgery. Medical therapies are also considered for 
many patients with CS, including those who are not surgical candidates or have 
persistent or recurrent hypercortisolism after surgery. Osilodrostat, an adrenal 
steroidogenesis inhibitor, demonstrated sustained efficacy and safety in phase 3 
clinical trials and is currently approved to treat endogenous CS in Europe and 
the United States. Because of limited clinical experience, questions remain 
about how to individualize osilodrostat treatment for different clinical 
scenarios and special populations. Additional guidance from experts based on 
clinical study and real-world experiences with osilodrostat is needed.
METHODS: A modified Delphi consensus panel study was conducted consisting of 13 
specialists from high-volume endocrinology centers with experience prescribing 
osilodrostat. Advisors participated in 3 consensus rounds (2 anonymous surveys, 
1 virtual workshop) over approximately 10 months to provide guidance and 
recommendations on optimal osilodrostat use.
RESULTS: Over 2 surveys and a 2-hour virtual workshop, 26 statements related to 
osilodrostat achieved consensus among Delphi panelists and 5 were excluded. 
Topics included patient preparation before osilodrostat initiation, baseline 
testing, dosing at onset and during treatment, managing dose adjustments, 
monitoring during dose titration, and treatment alterations for planned and 
unexpected clinical events.
CONCLUSION: Treatment guidance and recommendations for osilodrostat use were 
obtained using the Delphi method. These statements are intended to provide 
physicians with education and guidance on using osilodrostat to optimally treat 
patients with CS.

BACKGROUND: The single-anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy 
(SADI-S) combines the restrictive aspects of a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) with the 
hypoabsorptive advantages of a gastric bypass. SADI-S has demonstrated excellent 
weight loss outcomes and technical feasibility.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the benefits of SADI-S in patients with obesity and type 
2 diabetes mellitus.
SETTING: Academic and private practice hospitals, United States.
METHODS: Following the institutional review board (IRB) approval, a multicenter 
retrospective review was conducted to evaluate adult patients with obesity and 
type 2 diabetes who underwent SADI-S between January 1, 2013, and April 1, 2023. 
Type 2 diabetes remission was defined as a hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) value of <6.5% 
in the absence of any antidiabetic medication use. Patient demographics and 
bariatric and metabolic-related parameters were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 419 consecutive patients were identified with a median age 
of 50.0 years (interquartile range [IQR] 17) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 
47.1 ± 8.9 kg/m2. The mean percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was 31.9% with 
a type 2 diabetes remission rate of 60.1% and a mean follow-up period of 2.0 
years. Two hundred twenty-six patients were included in the final analysis. 
Preoperative insulin use and higher BMI were negative predictors of type 2 
diabetes remission, whereas greater %TWL was associated with a higher likelihood 
of type 2 diabetes remission at the last follow-up. On average, patients 
maintained reduced HbA1C values.
CONCLUSIONS: SADI-S is an effective and durable metabolic and bariatric surgery 
(MBS) for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Patients with higher 
preoperative BMI and insulin use are less likely to experience type 2 diabetes 
remission after surgery.

Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a disease associated with chronic inflammation, 
fibrosis and pain. There is a lack of tools available that facilitate early 
diagnosis, when intervention could prevent irreversible damage. Pilot data 
suggested prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a candidate biomarker for early CP. PGE2 
activates signaling pathways that promote inflammation, pain, and fibrosis. 
Methods: We assessed PGE2, metabolites, and downstream targets in pancreatic 
fluid collected endoscopically 0-10 (n=110) and 10-20 (n=111) minutes after 
intravenous secretin administration. PGE2 and metabolites were measured in 
plasma (n=75) and urine (n=71) from the same subjects. Subjects were enrolled in 
the PROCEED study and classified symptomatic controls, acute/recurrent acute 
pancreatitis (AP/RAP), or CP. Results: A significant main effect was detected in 
10-20 min pancreas fluid (p=0.027) and plasma (p=0.046); post-hoc testing showed 
PGE2 was lower in the AP/RAP group compared to symptomatic controls. There was 
also trend toward lower PGE2 in urine (p=0.062). To elucidate the active 
downstream pathways, calcitonin-gene related peptide, substance P, and matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 2, 3, 7, 9, and 13 were measured in pancreas fluid. 
A significant difference between the three groups was detected for both MMP7 and 
MMP9. MMP7 was elevated in individuals with CP versus AP/RAP (p=0.012) for 
samples collected early, but both time points for MMP9 (p=0.027, p=0.002). 
Discussion: While PGE2 is detectable in pancreas fluid, these data suggest that 
it may not be sensitive enough to distinguish between AP/RAP and CP. However, 
MMPs may distinguish between stages of pancreatitis and require further testing 
as potential diagnostic biomarkers.

Hemiarthroplasty Versus Total Hip Arthroplasty for Femoral Neck Fracture in the 
Elderly: An Analysis From the American Joint Replacement Registry.

BACKGROUND: Debate persists regarding management of displaced femoral neck 
fractures in elderly patients with either total hip arthroplasty (THA) or 
hemiarthroplasty (HA). We investigated the United States experience by comparing 
revision risk following THA or HA using the American Joint Replacement Registry 
in elderly femoral neck fractures.
METHODS: Between 2012 and 2020, we identified 65,958 patients within the 
American Joint Replacement Registry who were treated for a femoral neck fracture 
with arthroplasty. All were Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with 
a minimum potential follow-up of two years. The mean age was 82 years, and 69% 
were women. Total hip arthroplasty was utilized in 12,537 (19%). 
Hemiarthroplasty was used in 53,421 (81%), of which 58% were bipolar constructs. 
Dual-mobility (DM) constructs were used in 11% of THAs. Femoral components were 
cemented in 38%. A Cox proportional hazards model and a competing risk analysis 
were performed. Analytic groups included THA, THA with DM, bipolar HA, and 
unipolar HA. The mean follow-up was five years.
RESULTS: The 5-year cumulative risk of any revision was 3.2%. There were no 
significant differences in revision risk when comparing bipolar HA to unipolar 
HA, standard THA, or DM THA. Revision risk was not statistically different 
between unipolar HA and THA or DM THA. Older age and the use of cemented femoral 
components were associated with a reduced risk of revision (P < 0.0001), while 
patients with a higher comorbidity index sustained more revisions (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients who have displaced femoral neck fractures in the 
United States have a similar risk of revision whether they are treated with a 
THA or HA. However, this does not account for surgeon bias, host-related 
factors, and other technical features such as approach, limb length, and offset. 
Surgeons should base the procedure on the patient's functional demands and 
comorbidities.

Periarticular Injection in Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Randomized 
Clinical Trial Showing Similar Efficacy in Postoperative Analgesia.

BACKGROUND: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a bupivacaine and 
meloxicam extended-release (ER) intra-articular injection for pain during total 
knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, the real-world evidence with regard to 
analgesic efficacy of that medication has been limited. This randomized clinical 
trial investigated the efficacy of this new medication compared with our 
standard periarticular injection for postoperative analgesia after primary TKA.
METHODS: Eligible patients undergoing primary, unilateral TKA for osteoarthritis 
at our academic center were enrolled. Patients were blinded and were randomized 
1:1 to the bupivacaine-meloxicam ER (ZYNRELEF) injection group or the standard 
injection (ropivacaine, ketorolac, epinephrine) control group. A standardized, 
multimodal analgesic pathway was implemented. Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain 
scores and tallies of opioid consumption were collected. The primary outcome was 
the area under the curve (AUC) for NRS pain, adjusted for opioid consumption, 
over 72 hours. The minimal clinically important difference was considered to be 
30%. Power analysis determined a minimum of 44 patients per group. The final 
groups included 53 patients in the experimental group and 48 patients in the 
control group.
RESULTS: Similar postoperative analgesia was observed, with an AUC for the 
adjusted NRS pain score up to 72 hours of 331 in the experimental group and 373 
in the control group (p = 0.09). The mean maximum NRS pain scores were similar 
and reflected good, but not complete, analgesia. Scores were 3 to 5 on the day 
of the surgery, 4 to 6 on postoperative day (POD) 1, 5 to 6 on POD 2, and 4 to 5 
on POD 3 (p > 0.05). One patient in the experimental group and 2 patients in the 
control group had early postoperative complications, none of which was deemed to 
be related to the analgesic choice.
CONCLUSIONS: This randomized clinical trial demonstrated similar analgesia with 
a bupivacaine-meloxicam ER solution and a standard periarticular injection up to 
72 hours after primary TKA. Cost, reimbursement, and convenience may ultimately 
prove to be more important than analgesic differences when choosing between 
these 2 effective options for managing postoperative pain.

Conversion of a failed unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) to total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) is challenged by asymmetric bone loss necessitating advanced 
fixation strategies and alignment considerations. Robotic-assisted TKA is an 
increasingly utilized tool to augment preoperative surgical planning, improve 
intraoperative execution, and optimize patient outcomes. However, the use of 
robotic-assisted TKA in conversion UKA is not well described in the literature. 
We present the authors' preferred surgical technique of conversion UKA utilizing 
robotic assistance with a haptically guided robotic system and present a case 
example of a patient managed with this technique.

Health Sciences, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To examine change in weight status following initiation of 
lisdexamfetamine in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) and overweight or obesity.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective chart review included children aged 2 to <18 years 
treated with lisdexamfetamine for ADHD. Body mass index (BMI) data for up to 
2 years after initiation of lisdexamfetamine were analysed using linear mixed 
effects models with autoregressive-1 correlation structure on time of follow-up 
per patient.
RESULTS: The analysis included 330 children ≤18 years, median age 10 years 
(interquartile range 8.1-13) comprising 55 children with severe obesity, 88 with 
mild-moderate obesity, 131 with overweight and 56 with healthy weight, 68% male 
and 32% female. At 2 years after initiation of lisdexamfetamine in the severe 
obesity group, the BMI Z-score decreased by -0.41 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 
[-0.57, -0.25], p < 0.001) and BMI percent of the 95th percentile decreased by 
-11.2% (95% CI [-15.8 to -6.7], p < 0.001). In the mild-moderate obesity group, 
BMI Z-score decreased by -0.44 (95% CI [-0.56, -0.31], p < 0.001) and BMI% of 
the 95th percentile decreased by -11.1% at 24 months (95% CI [-13.9 to -8.4], 
p < 0.001). In the mild-moderate obesity and overweight groups, younger children 
(ages 4-10) showed greater reduction in their BMI (p < 0.001 and p = 0.029, 
respectively).
CONCLUSION: Reduction in BMI for age was noted for up to 2 years following 
initiation of lisdexamfetamine in children with ADHD and overweight and obesity. 
Further studies are warranted to study the weight loss effect of 
lisdexamfetamine in children with obesity.

BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is associated with a debilitating bone disease 
that poses significant therapeutic challenges. MM bone disease is characterized 
by increased bone resorption and suppression of osteoblasts, which hinders the 
repair of damaged bone. Sclerostin, an antagonist of Wnt signaling, is elevated 
in MM patients, and its inhibition with a neutralizing antibody (Scl-ab) has 
been shown to restore osteoblast function in mouse models of MM. However, it 
remains unclear whether Scl-ab can promote skeletal repair, enable effective 
tumor control when combined with anti-cancer agents, or improve bone health in 
MM patients.
METHODS: To investigate these knowledge gaps, we used preclinical MM mouse 
models and patient-derived samples. We also characterize the impact of Scl-ab on 
cancer and osteoblastic cells isolated from mouse models through bulk and 
single-cell RNA sequencing. Lastly, we performed a retrospective analysis of the 
efficacy of Scl-ab to improve bone health in patients with MM in remission.
RESULTS: Scl-ab promoted skeletal repair and enabled tumor suppression by an 
anti-cancer agent in various animal models of established MM bone disease. MM 
tumors suppressed Wnt signaling and decreased the number of osteoblasts and 
osteo-CAR cells, and treatment with Scl-ab reversed these effects. Treatment 
with Scl-ab increased bone mass and repaired bone in patients with MM in 
remission, even when combined with maintenance chemotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the potent bone-healing effects of Scl-ab 
and its potential as an adjuvant to anti-cancer therapy, offering a promising 
approach to improve clinical outcomes and the quality of life for MM patients.

OBJECTIVES: The optimal management of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors 
(RASIs) before noncardiac surgery remains unclear. Continuing RASIs may increase 
intraoperative hypotension, while discontinuation risks postoperative 
hypertension and heart failure. Current guidelines suggest withholding RASI 24 
hours prior to surgery, but evidence is limited. This meta-analysis of 
randomized controlled trials aimed to clarify the risks and benefits of 
continuing versus withholding RASIs in this setting.
DESIGN: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and 
meta-analysis.
SETTING: A comprehensive electronic search conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and 
Cochrane from inception to August 2024.
PARTICIPANTS: Nine clinical trials that collectively enrolled 8,906 patients 
undergoing noncardiac surgery.
INTERVENTIONS: A comparison of continuation versus discontinuation of RASIs 
preoperatively in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcomes were intraoperative 
hypotension, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and all-cause 
mortality. Secondary outcomes included acute kidney injury (AKI) and 
postoperative hypertension. Patients who discontinued RASIs had a significantly 
lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.84) compared to those who continued treatment. 
No significant differences were observed in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.85; 95% 
CI, 0.40-1.85), MACE (RR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.87-1.17), AKI (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 
0.79-1.22), and postoperative hypertension (RR, 1.57; 95% CI, 0.92-2.68).
CONCLUSIONS: Continuation of RASIs significantly increased the risk of 
intraoperative hypotension compared to discontinuation of treatment. Overall, no 
significant differences were observed in all-cause mortality, MACE, AKI, or 
postoperative hypertension between patients who continued or discontinued RASIs 
preoperatively.

OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the current 
evidence on the management of intermittent claudication (IC), a prevalent 
manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).
METHODS: We conducted comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
and Scopus. We addressed six questions developed by a guideline committee from 
the Society for Vascular Surgery, addressing pharmacological treatments, 
exercise regimens, endovascular interventions, and predictors of major adverse 
cardiovascular, limb-related events, and mortality.
RESULTS: The search resulted in 5333 citations, from which we included 73 
studies (46 randomized trials). In patients with PAD and IC who had one or more 
high-risk comorbidities, low-dose rivaroxaban and aspirin were associated with 
lower risk of major adverse limb events and major adverse cardiovascular events 
than aspirin alone. In patients who have undergone surgical or endovascular 
interventions for PAD, the addition of low-dose rivaroxaban to aspirin may 
improve limb outcomes. Of note, rivaroxaban trials excluded patients at high 
risk of bleeding. Single antiplatelet agents showed no significant efficacy 
differences head-to-head in ambulatory patients with IC and had a lower bleeding 
risk compared with combination therapy or anticoagulation. Home exercise 
programs were feasible and may be an alternative to supervised exercise in 
ambulatory patients with IC and in those who had revascularization. Several 
comorbidities increased the risk of adverse outcomes after revascularization for 
IC, such as advanced age, diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, previous interventions, congestive heart failure, 
infrapopliteal artery involvement, and longer lesion lengths. In patients with 
IC undergoing endovascular intervention for superficial femoral artery disease, 
plain balloon angioplasty was associated with worse outcomes than drug elution 
or stent implantation for intermediate or longer lesions (ie, >5 cm).
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review summarizes the current evidence base for the 
management of IC, offering insights into the relative benefits and risks of 
various therapeutic strategies. The findings underscore the need for 
individualized patient care, considering both the potential benefits and risks 
associated with different interventions.

BACKGROUND: Despite advances in diagnosis and management, the interstitial lung 
disease (ILD) lexicon is plagued by ambiguous and inconsistent terminology that 
complicates communication and impedes knowledge generation. The objective of 
this Fleischner Society Consensus Statement was to produce standardized 
terminology for ILD multidisciplinary diagnoses and major phenotypes.
METHODS: Interviews with 10 experts were used to identify ILD clinical diagnoses 
and major phenotypes. The preferred term for each entity and potential 
alternatives were identified, alongside rationale for the preferred term. 
Entities with >1 potential term were the subject of an online modified Delphi 
survey posed to the 29 committee members, aiming to achieve consensus. Committee 
members rated their agreement with the initially preferred term (strongly agree, 
agree, neutral/unsure, disagree, strongly disagree; scored from 5 to 1, 
respectively), with the option to provide additional comments. Median score 4 
and interquartile range 1 was considered consensus agreement. Terms not 
reaching agreement were discussed by video conference, followed by an additional 
survey that incorporated feedback.
RESULTS: From the 60 initial terms, there were 2 root terms that required 
upfront consensus prior to survey initiation (ILD and interstitial pneumonia) 
and another 8 terms that had no alternative suggested by the committee or in the 
literature. Agreement was met by 47/50 terms (94%) in round 1 of the survey. The 
3 terms (6%) not reaching agreement met agreement in round 2.
CONCLUSIONS: This document provides standardized recommended terms for ILD 
multidisciplinary diagnoses and major phenotypes that will facilitate 
communication among clinicians, researchers, patients, and other stakeholders.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuromodulation of the centromedian nucleus (CM) of the 
thalamus has shown promise in treating refractory epilepsy, particularly for 
idiopathic generalized epilepsy and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. However, precise 
targeting of CM remains challenging. The combination of deep learning 
reconstruction (DLR) and fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery 
(FGATIR) offers potential improvements in visualization of CM for deep brain 
stimulation (DBS) targeting. The goal of the study was to evaluate the 
visualization of the putative CM on DLR-FGATIR and its alignment with 
atlas-defined CM boundaries, with the aim of facilitating direct targeting of CM 
for neuromodulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 12 patients with 
drug-resistant epilepsy treated with thalamic neuromodulation by using 
DLR-FGATIR for direct targeting. Postcontrast-T1-weighted MRI, DLR-FGATIR, and 
postoperative CT were coregistered and normalized into Montreal Neurological 
Institute (MNI) space and compared with the Morel histologic atlas. 
Contrast-to-noise ratios were measured between CM and neighboring nuclei. CM 
segmentations were compared between an experienced rater, a trainee rater, the 
Morel atlas, and the Thalamus Optimized Multi Atlas Segmentation (THOMAS) atlas 
(derived from expert segmentation of high-field MRI) by using the Sorenson-Dice 
coefficient (Dice score, a measure of overlap) and volume ratios. The number of 
electrode contacts within the Morel atlas CM was assessed.
RESULTS: On DLR-FGATIR, CM was visible as an ovoid hypointensity in the 
intralaminar thalamus. Contrast-to-noise ratios were highest (P < .001) for the 
mediodorsal and medial pulvinar nuclei. Dice score with the Morel atlas CM was 
higher (median 0.49, interquartile range 0.40-0.58) for the experienced rater (P 
< .001) than the trainee rater (0.32, 0.19-0.46) and no different (P = .32) than 
the THOMAS atlas CM (0.56, 0.55-0.58). Both raters and the THOMAS atlas tended 
to under-segment the lateral portion of the Morel atlas CM, reflected by smaller 
segmentation volumes (P < .001). All electrodes targeting CM based on DLR-FGATIR 
traversed the Morel atlas CM.
CONCLUSIONS: DLR-FGATIR permitted visualization and delineation of CM 
commensurate with a group atlas derived from high-field MRI. This technique 
provided reliable guidance for accurate electrode placement within CM, 
highlighting its potential use for direct targeting.

Unique challenges are encountered when providing an obturator for an adolescent 
patient. Challenges include the need to modify the obturator throughout growth, 
engaging the mixed dentition or partially erupted teeth with minimal undercuts, 
the psychosocial challenges of an actively maturing patient, and the possible 
need for coincidental orthodontic therapy. This clinical report describes the 
ongoing rehabilitation of a patient who presented at the age of 10 with a 
biopsy-confirmed palatal mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Incorporating orthodontic 
brackets for retention of innovative adjustable obturator clasps allowed for the 
favorable function of the obturator prosthesis and the ability to alter the 
prosthesis over time.

BACKGROUND: Glenoid dysplasia (GD) is a developmental anomaly associated with 
early development of glenohumeral osteoarthritis. In this cohort, shoulder 
arthroplasty remains a technically challenging operation due to associated bony 
deficiency and excessive retroversion. This systematic review aimed to evaluate 
the clinical and radiographic outcomes, assess the incidence of complications, 
and measure satisfaction following shoulder arthroplasty for the management of 
glenohumeral osteoarthritis in patients with GD.
METHODS: A computerized search of MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of 
Controlled Trials, Web of Science, and Scopus, with manual screening of selected 
article reference lists, was performed in July 2024. Studies examining 
associations between GD and clinical outcome, radiographic results, 
complications, reoperations, or patient satisfaction following anatomic total 
shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA), reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA), or 
shoulder hemiarthroplasty (HA) were included. Methodological quality was 
assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: Seven studies with a mean modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale score of 10.9 
± 1.3 were included, consisting of 84 aTSA, 13 rTSA, and 22 HA cases in total. 
Over 2.3-8.5 years of follow-up, the majority of patients experienced marked 
improvements in shoulder function and pain, demonstrating good to excellent 
clinical assessment scores and range of motion. Glenoid lucent lines (55.6%), 
asymptomatic calcification of the triceps insertion (30.8%), and glenoid erosion 
(31.8%) represented the most common radiographic abnormalities following aTSA, 
rTSA, and HA, respectively. Complications and reoperations were present at rates 
of 9.2% and 12.3%, respectively. However, more than 80% of patients considered 
their level of satisfaction to be good or excellent.
CONCLUSION: Shoulder arthroplasty represents a safe and reliable option for the 
management of symptomatic GD, offering improved clinical outcomes and favorable 
satisfaction following surgery. Special attention must still be taken to 
surgically address the bony deficiency and retroversion associated with GD to 
mitigate the risk of complication and reoperation.

Circulating glucagon concentrations differ between individuals with no diabetes 
(ND) and those with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We combined an isotope dilution 
technique using stable tracers [6,22-13C9,15N1]glucagon and 
[6,14,19,22-13C9,15N1]glucagon with splanchnic and leg catheterization in 
participants with ND (n = 8; age 23.1 ± 2.9 years, BMI 26.6 ± 3.5 kg/m2, HbA1c 
5.0 ± 0.2% [31 ± 2 mmol/mol]) and T1D (n = 6; 29.0 ± 8.8 years, BMI 26.3 ± 5.0 
kg/m2, HbA1c 7.9 ± 0.8% [63 ± 8 mmol/mol]) in the overnight fasted state. After 
baseline period, exogenous glucagon was infused at rates designed to achieve 
plasma glucagon concentrations spanning the physiological ranges, to determine 
the effects of rising glucagon concentrations on splanchnic and leg glucagon 
balance. At baseline, splanchnic glucagon extraction (SGE) was similar (30.7 ± 
2.7 vs. 29.1 ± 2.9%) but leg glucagon extraction (LGE) was lower (27.0 ± 4.2 vs. 
40.6 ± 3.1%) in participants with T1D versus those with ND. However, with 
increasing plasma glucagon concentrations, while SGE remained unchanged within 
and between groups, LGE fell in participants with ND (41 vs. 31 vs. 24%) but did 
not change in those with T1D. Despite a numerically lower net splanchnic 
glucagon production in participants with T1D than in those with ND, no changes 
were observed with increasing glucagon concentrations within the physiological 
range in both groups. This is the first human study applying novel glucagon 
isotopes that describes regional glucagon metabolism in participants with ND and 
T1D. Our observations provide translational relevance for dual hormone 
closed-loop systems and provide tools for probing the effects of GLP-1, dual, 
and triple receptor agonists on pancreatic α-cell functions.
ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: This study was conducted to assess splanchnic and leg 
glucagon metabolism in humans using stable glucagon isotopes. We wanted to 
evaluate whether splanchnic and leg glucagon metabolism differed between 
participants with no diabetes (ND) and those with type 1 diabetes (T1D) at 
glucagon concentrations spanning the physiological range. Whereas splanchnic 
glucagon extraction did not differ between participants with ND and those with 
T1D, leg glucagon extraction fell in those with ND but did not change in those 
with T1D as glucagon concentrations increased. Net splanchnic glucagon 
production did not change with exogenous glucagon infusion. Our study has 
implications for dual hormone closed-loop control in T1D where glucagon is 
infused for prevention of hypoglycemia and for investigating the effects of 
emerging GLP-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and glucagon 
receptor agonists on endogenous glucagon secretion and clearance.

BACKGROUND: The performance of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) among 
patients with heart failure (HF) may be worse than in the general population due 
to a higher prevalence of confounding factors affecting creatinine and cystatin 
C. Studies in this area are scarce and not stratified by type of HF. We 
evaluated the performance of current creatinine and cystatin C equations (eGFR 
creatinine-based equation [eGFRcr], eGFR serum cystatin C-based, and eGFR 
creatinine-cystatin C equation) compared with measured GFR (mGFR) among patients 
with HF stratified by ejection fraction.
METHODS: We pulled data on Mayo Clinic patients with an mGFR performed for 
clinical indications from 2011 to 2023, with serum creatinine and cystatin C 
measured within 7 days and an echocardiogram performed up to 1 year before the 
mGFR date. HF was identified by the presence of International Classification of 
Diseases codes within 1 year before the mGFR and subgrouped into ejection 
fraction (EF) ≥50% (HFEF ≥50%, n=182) or <50% (HFEF<50%, n=115) and compared 
with no-HF controls (n=1871). CKD-EPI eGFRcr, eGFR serum cystatin C-based, and 
eGFR creatinine-cystatin C equations were calculated, and compared for bias 
(mGFR minus eGFR) and accuracy (1-P30, proportion of people with ≥30% difference 
between eGFR and mGFR). CIs were generated by bootstrapping.
RESULTS: The HF groups were characterized by older age, higher proportion of 
males, more diabetes, higher creatinine, and higher cystatin C than controls. 
eGFRcr overestimated mGFR to a greater extent in both HF groups as compared with 
controls, whereas the eGFR serum cystatin C-based equation showed similar 
underestimation in both HF groups and controls. In the HF groups, cystatin 
C-based equations were more accurate than eGFRcr particularly within HFEF <50% 
(1-P30 of 28% and 34% for eGFR serum cystatin C-based and eGFR 
creatinine-cystatin C equations, respectively, versus 60% for eGFRcr), whereas 
eGFR creatinine-cystatin C equation was more accurate in controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HF, eGFRcr demonstrates inferior performance 
(more bias and less accuracy) compared with cystatin C-based eGFRs, with this 
effect being more pronounced in those with HFEF <50%.

BACKGROUND: High-Sensitivity Troponin test results span a wide range of clinical 
values, from <5 ng/L to >5000 ng/L.
DISCUSSION: At the low end of the spectrum (≤100 ng/L for most assays), there 
are several domains with unique decision points based upon thresholds derived 
from validation studies. Thus, we propose a novel Trop-Zone approach as an 
evidence-based and user-friendly guide to clinical decision-making within these 
domains.
CONCLUSION: In this review, we aim to provide a concise summary of recent 
Guidelines, describe the impact of validation studies, and propose a novel 
"Trop-Zone" approach that we believe is simpler than existing flowcharts.

In this document, we discuss the main difficulties faced by investigators in 
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and propose potential solutions. 
Challenges include the scarcity of experts in rare disorders, higher costs of 
supplies, underfunding, and limited patient advocacy groups. Establishing 
collaborations among patient advocacy groups, governments, investigators, and 
other stakeholders to create action plans can address many of these issues and 
promote research into rare diseases.

Recent decades have seen a rise in the incidence of tick-borne diseases in the 
US, along with an increased number of pathogens transmitted by ticks, and 
geographic expansion of tick populations. A variety of laboratory testing 
methodologies are available for the diagnosis of tick-borne diseases, including 
serology, microscopy, and molecular-based methods. The preferred approach varies 
by the specific disease, locally available test options, and the stage of 
illness at patient presentation. This mini-review focuses on updates in our 
understanding of the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases in the US and advances 
in the field of laboratory diagnostics.

CONTEXT.—: A clinic was created for patients to review their explanted organs 
with a pathologist.
OBJECTIVE.—: To prospectively investigate the benefits of this type of clinic as 
perceived by both transplant patients and their pathologists.
DESIGN.—: In this prospective study, patients participated in a videotaped 
viewing of heart and/or lung explants by the patient and their guest(s) and 
pathologist (December 2017-August 2022). Patients received a 3D-printed replica 
of their explant. After viewing the explanted organ, patients and their guests 
participated in an interview to assess their experiences. Video-reflexive 
ethnography was used by pathologists for data collection and practice 
improvement.
RESULTS.—: Of 143 patients who viewed their explanted organ, 21 patients 
consented to having the organ-viewing session taped and to participate in a 
postviewing interview. The study group was comprised of 12 men; the median age 
was 57.5 years (range, 29-67 years). Five pathologists took part in reflexive 
sessions. The clinics were viewed positively by patients, providing an 
opportunity to better understand their disease. Pathologists had a similarly 
positive experience and gained important insights to patient journeys. Proposals 
for improvement were brought forward from both patients and pathologists.
CONCLUSIONS.—: Video-reflexive ethnography provided the opportunity for patients 
and pathologists to reflect on patient-pathology clinic appointments. This work 
serves as a template to build out pathology-based clinics.

IMPORTANCE: Radiation therapy is infrequently used in the treatment of advanced 
ovarian cancer due to the propensity for peritoneal spread and dose limitations 
of classical large field techniques. However, for patients with limited sites of 
recurrence, advanced radiation techniques such as SBRT may offer an effective 
treatment option.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety, preliminary efficacy, quality-of-life 
outcomes, and tumor perfusion changes in patients with limited locoregional 
recurrences of ovarian cancer treated with SBRT.
METHODS: Patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer 
and ≤ 3 total sites of disease were eligible for this phase I 3 + 3 
dose-escalation study.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients were accrued and SBRT dose was safely escalated to 
dose-level 3 (30 Gy in 3 fractions) without dose-limiting toxicity. There were 
no grade 2 or higher SBRT-related toxicities. One-year LC, PFS, and OS were 
95 %, 45 %, and 100 %, respectively. The majority of patients received SBRT on 
study in lieu of systemic therapy (67 %), and 70 % of these patients remained 
off systemic therapy at one-year follow-up. At one year after completion of 
SBRT, global health status/QOL patient reported outcomes were maintained from 
baseline values. Perfusion imaging demonstrated increases in tumor blood flow 
(p = 0.02) after delivery of the first fraction of SBRT and decreases in blood 
flow (p < 0.01) and blood volume (p < 0.01) from fraction 1 to 6 weeks after 
SBRT.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This Phase I trial offers preliminary evidence that 
SBRT can be safe and effective for limited site locoregional recurrences of 
ovarian cancer.

PURPOSE: Surgical site infection (SSI) following open radical cystectomy (ORC) 
is common and carries significant morbidity. Incisional negative pressure wound 
therapy (iNPWT) has not been rigorously studied in this population. Herein, we 
evaluate the association between prophylactic iNPWT and postoperative wound 
complications in ORC patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried our institutional, prospectively maintained 
cystectomy registry for patients who underwent ORC between 2000 and 2023, and 
stratified patients by receipt of prophylactic iNPWT. The primary outcome was 
SSI incidence within 90-days following surgery. Secondary outcomes included 
90-day wound dehiscence, symptomatic seroma, and a composite endpoint of any of 
those 3 wound events. Multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for 
patient characteristics.
RESULTS: Among 2,375 patients who underwent ORC, 124(5.2%) received prophylactic 
iNPWT. Patients who received iNPWT had higher rates of SSI risk factors: median 
BMI (31 vs. 28, P < 0.01), diabetes (28% vs. 18%, P = 0.01), and ileal conduit 
diversion (86% vs. 71%, P < 0.01). On unadjusted analyses, SSI incidence was 
6.5% and 10.4% for the iNPWT and non-iNPWT cohorts, respectively. After 
adjusting for baseline characteristics, prophylactic iNPWT was associated with a 
significantly lower odds of SSI (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.22-0.99, P = 0.048). No 
significant associations were observed between iNPWT utilization and secondary 
outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic iNPWT therapy is associated with a reduced risk of SSI 
following ORC. While prospective and randomized corroboration is warranted, 
these data support the incorporation of this low-cost intervention into 
postoperative pathways for high-risk ORC patients.

Background: Glycemic control has been studied in hospitalized patients with type 
1 diabetes (T1D) or type 2 diabetes (T2D) and more recently type 3C diabetes who 
had total pancreatectomy (TP) and islet autotransplantation (IAT). To our 
knowledge, we report the first study using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) 
to assess glucose control in TP without IAT during hospitalization. Methods: We 
completed blinded CGM (Dexcom G6 PRO) studies in 27 subjects in a nonintensive 
care unit setting who had TP at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, and compared two cohorts 
(CGM data < 30 days of TP [cohort 1] vs. ≥ 30 days of TP [cohort 2]). CGM 
glucose metrics were calculated as per American Diabetes Association guidelines 
for hospitalized patients with diabetes mellitus. CGM values were compared with 
point-of-care testing glucose within 5 min. Results: The baseline 
characteristics were not significantly different between the cohorts Table 1. 
The average TIGHT range (140 mg/dL-180 mg/dL) on day 1 was 13 ± 12.0 % in cohort 
1 and 17.4 ± 27.7 % in cohort 2 without any statistically significant 
difference, while average TIGHT percentage on days 2-10 was 23.4% ± 25.8% and 
20.6% ± 25.7% in cohort 1 and cohort 2, respectively (no statistically 
significant difference). Both cohorts spent the majority of (>50%) time above 
target range on day 1 and days 2-10. There were no significant differences in 
CGM metrics between the two cohorts. Overall, mean absolute relative difference 
was 19.6% ± 10, and number of readings meeting % 20/20, was 68% with least 
accuracy on day 1 of sensor insertion. There were no device-related adverse 
events. [Table: see text] Conclusion: Hospitalized TP patients spend 
considerable time above 180 mg/dL demonstrating the unmet need of optimal 
glucose monitoring in this cohort.

PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence, associated conditions, diagnostic and 
treatment modalities, and provider education regarding the diagnosis and 
management of keratoconus (KCN) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) based on the 
currently available body of literature.
METHODS: Peer-reviewed publications from any year and any language were 
included. The databases included Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
Embase, and Ovid. A separate search of African Journals Online was conducted 
using the same Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms as the database search. 
Additional publications were identified in the references during full-text 
extraction. The abstracts of all publications were evaluated by two reviewers. 
The full text was then examined by one reviewer for inclusion. A data extraction 
tool was used by a single reviewer to document the findings.
RESULTS: Sixty-two publications were included in data extraction. Fourteen 
countries in SSA were represented. Prevalence was reported in eight SSA 
countries and ranged from 0% to 2.8%. The highest prevalence of 1.2% was found 
in a cross-sectional study in Banjul, Gambia. Diagnosis in urban areas is often 
made using slit lamps, although some sites had access to keratometry and/or 
topography, whereas rural areas use penlight exams alone. Penetrating 
keratoplasty was reported as an available treatment in 14 manuscripts, glasses 
and hard contact lenses in 10, and corneal cross-linking in two. Publications 
discussing provider education reported a knowledge gap.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for increased data on KCN in SSA to better inform 
public health policy to improve KCN patients' access to care and quality of 
life.

Immune tolerance restricts the number of T cells with significant affinity for 
self tumor associated antigens (TAA), thereby limiting successful cancer 
immunotherapy through an inability to generate populations of high affinity 
anti-tumor T cells. In contrast, viral infection/vaccination primes and expands 
high affinity effector and memory T cells against viral antigens. We show here 
that it is possible to exploit population-wide pre-existing, anti-viral memory 
recall responses against SARS-CoV-2 antigens to focus a high affinity, 
immuno-dominant T cell response into tumors by oncolytic virus (OV)-, or CAR-, 
mediated-, delivery of viral antigen(s) which are not themselves related to TAA. 
Heterologous prime and OV/boost led to CD8+ T cell-dependent tumor cures using 
either SARS-CoV-2 Mem or SPIKE proteins as vaccinating/tumor focusing T cell 
targets, associated with epitope spreading against TAA. We also show that CAR T 
cells carry SARS-CoV-2 antigen-expressing vectors systemically to tumors even in 
pre-immune mice. Finally, SPIKE-specific CAR T cells could be boosted in vivo 
with SPIKE vaccines to enhance anti-tumor activity and persistence. Thus, where 
high affinity anti-tumor T cells are not available, boosting pre-existing 
infection-, or vaccination-, induced T cell populations within tumors using 
OV-mediated immunogen delivery provides a therapeutically valuable alternative.

BACKGROUND: The optimal duration for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after 
stent-assisted coiling (SAC) of intracranial aneurysms is unclear. Longer-term 
therapy may reduce thrombotic complications but increase the risk of bleeding 
complications.
METHODS: A retrospective review of prospectively maintained data at 12 
institutions was conducted on patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms 
who underwent SAC between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020, and were 
followed ≥6 months postprocedure. The type and duration of DAPT, stent(s) used, 
outcome, length of follow-up, complication rates, and incidence of significant 
in-stent stenosis (ISS) were collected.
RESULTS: Of 556 patients reviewed, 450 met all inclusion criteria. Nine patients 
treated with DAPT <29 days after SAC and 11 treated for 43-89 days were excluded 
from the final analysis as none completed their prescribed duration of 
treatment. Eighty patients received short-term DAPT. There were no significant 
differences in the rate of thrombotic complications during predefined periods of 
risk in the short, medium, or long-term treatment groups (1/80, 1.3%; 2/188, 
1.1%; and 0/162, 0%, respectively). Similarly, no differences were found in the 
rate of hemorrhagic complications during period of risk in any group (0/80, 0%; 
3/188, 1.6%; and 1/162, 0.6%, respectively). Longer duration DAPT did not reduce 
ISS risk in any group.
CONCLUSIONS: Continuing DAPT >42 days after SAC did not reduce the risk of 
thrombotic complications or in-stent stenosis, although the risk of additional 
hemorrhagic complications remained low. It may be reasonable to discontinue DAPT 
after 42 days following non-flow diverting SAC of unruptured intracranial 
aneurysms.

Electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs) can improve care for 
people with cancer, but effectiveness hinges on well-supported integration in 
clinical settings.We evaluated clinician use of specific clinical decision 
support (CDS) tools in the electronic health record (EHR) designed to facilitate 
timely, clinically appropriate responses to ePROM scores for six symptoms 
commonly experienced by cancer patients.The parent pragmatic trial, which took 
place at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, United States) and its affiliated 
community health care system between March 2019 and January 2023, evaluated the 
population-level effectiveness and implementation of an ePROM surveillance and 
EHR-facilitated collaborative care symptom management intervention. The present 
evaluation used a case study approach with four data sources: (1) clinician 
interactions with CDS tools abstracted from the EHR; (2) clinician notes 
identified with an institution-specific textual search tool; (3) qualitative 
interviews and group discussions with care teams; and (4) administrative records 
reviewed to identify training and outreach to care teams.EHR metrics showed very 
low adoption of CDS tools including alerts and symptom-specific order sets, 
despite educational outreach and information technology support provided to 
clinical care teams. Qualitative findings revealed that CDS use was not easy to 
integrate into busy clinical workflows and highlighted clinician perceptions 
that the collaborative care intervention provided additional patient support 
that reduced clinicians' need to utilize CDS tools. They also highlight the 
importance of contextual factors, including institutional priorities and EHR 
changes.This pragmatic clinical trial case study found limited adoption of EHR 
CDS tools that had been developed to increase clinicians' awareness of and 
responses to ePROM data. Findings suggest the need to align clinician and 
organizational implementation strategies, simplify CDS tools to fit practice 
expectations, and identify and address contextual factors that could undercut 
strategies like education and peer support. This may be especially important for 
teams who aim to iteratively evaluate and refine CDS and implementation 
strategies for multicomponent interventions or introduce new strategies that are 
responsive to barriers while maintaining scalability.

The use of biologics in food allergy management is an emerging area; therefore, 
guidance is required for payers to ensure appropriate access. AMCP Market 
Insights undertook a multiphase program to refine proposed actions from a 
previous program into a set of payer best practices in food allergy management 
and to gain insights on gaps in knowledge regarding food allergy mechanisms and 
management. The program included a national survey of managed care 
professionals, individual expert interviews, and a moderated expert roundtable. 
Best practices identified were to increase awareness of food allergy mechanisms, 
mitigate accidental exposure impact, support behavioral health needs, ensure 
access to emergency medications, consider social determinants of health and 
equity, and assess cost-effectiveness. Best practices specific to omalizumab, 
which is currently the only biologic approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration, were to establish appropriate initial coverage criteria and 
develop appropriate ongoing coverage criteria.

OBJECTIVE: Open surgical repair is the first-line treatment for patients with 
complex aortic aneurysms and heritable thoracic aortic diseases (HTADs). 
Fenestrated-branched endovascular aortic repair (FB-EVAR) has been used 
selectively in higher-risk patients. This study assessed early- and midterm 
outcomes of FB-EVAR for complex aortic aneurysms in patients with HTADs.
METHODS: We reviewed clinical data, imaging, and outcomes of consecutive 
patients treated by FB-EVAR for complex abdominal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms 
from April 2007 to June 2024. Patients with confirmed Marfan syndrome, 
Loeys-Dietz syndrome, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or ACTA2 mutation were 
included. End points included 30-day mortality and major adverse events, 
cumulative incidence of aortic-related mortality, aortic aneurysm rupture, and 
secondary interventions.
RESULTS: Among 850 patients (median age, 58 years; interquartile range, 49-70 
years; 8 [53%] men) treated by FB-EVAR for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms 
and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 15 (1.8%) had confirmed HTADs. Technical 
success was achieved with no early mortality in all patients. Early outcomes 
showed no cerebrovascular or major cardiac events. One patient developed delayed 
paraparesis with complete recovery. Median follow-up was 20 months 
(interquartile range, 13-34 months) with no aortic-related mortality and aortic 
aneurysm rupture. One patient developed a late retrograde dissection treated by 
thoracic endovascular aortic repair. Patient survival and cumulative incidence 
of secondary interventions at 1 year were 93% ± 16% and 10.0% (95% CI, 
0.0%-26.8%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: FB-EVAR in select patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HTADs was 
associated with high technical success and no early mortality. Midterm outcomes 
revealed no aortic-related mortality or aortic aneurysm rupture, but 1 in 3 
patients required secondary interventions, highlighting the importance of 
continuous surveillance in this population.

BACKGROUND: The differences in outcomes between dorsal preservation (DP) and 
dorsal reduction (DR) techniques in rhinoplasty remain unclear. This 
meta-analysis evaluates the DP and DR in terms of functional and aesthetic 
outcomes, revisions surgeries, dorsal irregularities, and residual and recurrent 
hump.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase up to January 20th, 2025, for 
studies comparing DP versus DR. Primary outcome was standardized functional 
scores in the long-term postoperative period. Secondary outcomes were: 
short-term standardized functional outcomes, subjective aesthetic outcomes 
(sort-term and long-term), long-term standardized aesthetic outcome and total 
SCHNOS, revisions surgeries needed, dorsal irregularities, and residual and 
recurrent hump. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate different scales 
(SCHNOS, NOSE, VAS and UQ).
RESULTS: Ten studies (1339 patients) were included. DP showed a significantly 
higher satisfaction in the UQ subgroup for short-term subjective aesthetic 
outcome (MD 1.13 points [95% CI: 0.74-1.52]; p < 0.001; I² = 0%), a significant 
reduction in dorsal irregularities (RR 0.28 [95% CI: 0.10-0.78]; p = 0.01; I² = 
0%), and a significantly higher rate of residual and recurrent hump (RR 2.94 
[95% CI: 1.23-7.03]; p = 0.02; I² = 0%), compared to the DR group. No 
significant differences were found in standardized functional outcomes, 
subjective aesthetic outcomes, standardized aesthetic outcomes, total SCHNOS, or 
revision surgeries.
CONCLUSION: DP was associated with greater short-term aesthetic satisfaction 
(UQ), fewer dorsal irregularities, and a higher risk of residual and recurrent 
hump compared to DR. There were no significant differences between the groups in 
the other outcomes.

Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant potential to enhance various 
aspects of oncology, spanning the cancer care continuum. This review provides an 
overview of current and emerging AI applications, from risk assessment and early 
detection to treatment and supportive care. AI-driven tools are being developed 
to integrate diverse data sources, including multi-omics and electronic health 
records, to improve cancer risk stratification and personalize prevention 
strategies. In screening and diagnosis, AI algorithms show promise in augmenting 
the accuracy and efficiency of medical image analysis and histopathology 
interpretation. AI also offers opportunities to refine treatment planning, 
optimize radiation therapy, and personalize systemic therapy selection. 
Furthermore, AI is explored for its potential to improve survivorship care by 
tailoring interventions and to enhance end-of-life care through improved symptom 
management and prognostic modeling. Beyond care delivery, AI augments clinical 
workflows, streamlines the dissemination of up-to-date evidence, and captures 
critical patient-reported outcomes for clinical decision support and outcomes 
assessment. However, the successful integration of AI into clinical practice 
requires addressing key challenges, including rigorous validation of algorithms, 
ensuring data privacy and security, and mitigating potential biases. Effective 
implementation necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration and comprehensive 
education for health care professionals. The synergistic interaction between AI 
and clinical expertise is crucial for realizing the potential of AI to 
contribute to personalized and effective cancer care. This review highlights the 
current state of AI in oncology and underscores the importance of responsible 
development and implementation.

Despite adherence to transplantation selection criteria, such as the Milan 
criteria, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence after liver transplantation 
(LT) occurs in 8-20% of cases. This highlights the need for improved patient 
selection strategies and better post-LT management to mitigate recurrence risks. 
This narrative review explores current approaches for managing HCC recurrence 
post-LT, with a focus on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Surgery or 
locoregional therapies are preferred but are often unsuitable for disseminated 
disease, leaving systemic therapies-including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, and regorafenib-as primary options. Although ICIs 
have shown promise in advanced HCC and are increasingly used in LT settings, 
evidence for their post-LT application remains limited to case reports and 
series. Post-LT care is especially challenging due to the concurrent use of 
immunosuppressants, requiring a balance between managing acute rejection and 
administering ICI agents. This dual approach necessitates identifying biomarkers 
to predict ICI efficacy and allograft rejection. Key strategies may include 
using anti-CTLA-4 agents with potentially lower rejection rates, delaying ICI 
initiation post-LT, and optimizing combination immunosuppression regimens 
centered on tacrolimus. However, ICIs should be reserved for select cases or 
clinical trials, with multidisciplinary team collaboration being critical. 
Prospective studies are needed to establish clear guidelines for their use in 
post-LT care.

BACKGROUND: Primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) in young patients presents 
surgical challenges due to preoperative conditions and the likelihood of an 
active postoperative lifestyle. This study assessed mid-term (mean 7.5 years) 
survivorship and risk factors for revisions and reoperations in patients aged 
≤30 undergoing primary THA.
METHODS: We reviewed 353 patients (428 hips) aged ≤30 years who underwent 
primary THA between 2000 and 2020. The average follow-up was 7.5 years (range, 2 
to 22), and the mean age at surgery was 23 years, with 51% being women. The mean 
BMI was 27 (range, 15 to 51). Common diagnoses included osteonecrosis (30%), hip 
dysplasia (25%), and osteoarthritis (14%). Bearing surfaces included 
ceramic-on-highly-cross-linked polyethylene (C-XP) in 192 hips (45%), 
ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) in 156 hips (37%), and metal-on-highly-cross-linked 
polyethylene (M-XP) in 78 hips (18%). Revisions, reoperations, and the latest 
follow-up were end points in survivorship analyses. Cox regression model 
identified predictive variables.
RESULTS: Survivorship-free revision was 97, 94, and 88% at 5, 10, and 15 years, 
respectively, while survivorship-free reoperation was 96, 93, and 87% at the 
same time intervals. Complications occurred in 67 cases, with the most common 
being instability (28%), intraoperative fractures (18%), and periprosthetic 
joint infection (15%). Index THA secondary to infection increased the risk of 
reoperation (hazard ratio [HR] = 11.48, P = 0.0081). The 28-mm femoral head 
sizes and M-XP bearings increased the risk of complications (HR = 1.88, P < 
0.043 and HR = 1.89, P < 0.031). Cemented stems were associated with 
complications (HR = 2.53, P < 0.0036), revision (HR = 7.79, P < 0.0001), and 
reoperations (HR = 8.02, P < 0.0001). Extended femoral osteotomy and lateral 
approaches were associated with higher complication rates (HR = 7.49, P < 0.0008 
and HR = 9.70, P < 0.0001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: At 15 years, patients ≤30 years undergoing modern THA showed high 
survivorship. Factors associated with increased complexity, such as the use of 
cemented stems, preoperative infection, and extended approaches, were associated 
with higher failure rates.

PURPOSE: To describe outcomes for internal microneedle drainage for the 
management of residual subretinal fluid (SRF) during pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) 
for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).
METHODS: Retrospective review of patients undergoing PPV for RRD using a 
40-gauge angled and beveled microneedle (Incyto, South Korea) for the aspiration 
and drainage of SRF during fluid/air exchange. The microneedle is inserted 
through the neurosensory retina into the bleb of residual SRF, removed from the 
subretinal space and placed onto the retina or adjacent to the subretinal entry 
site. Visual acuity (VA) and safety outcomes are reported.
RESULTS: Thirteen eyes from 13 patients with a median age (Q1 - Q3) of 61.12 
(52.03-63.81) were included. Median visual acuity (VA) at baseline was 0.52 
(0.24-0.8) logMAR (approx. 20/66) and significantly improved to 0.1 (0.02-0.26) 
logMAR (approx. 20/25) at the last available follow-up time point (p = 0.0167). 
Macula-off RRD had significantly worse VA at baseline 0.58 (0.3-1.0) logMAR 
(approx. 20/76) compared to macula-on RRD 0.15 (0.105-0.25) logMAR (approx. 
20/28), p = 0.0196) but improved significantly to the last available follow-up 
(p = 0.0391), matching those with macula-on RRD. The use of microneedle drainage 
was safe and resulted in an attached retina in all 13 (100%) cases without 
adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Microneedle drainage is safe, while patient outcomes are excellent. 
The complete aspiration of SRF might reduce complications associated with PPV 
for RRD and optimize visual outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Motion-sparing approaches to scoliosis surgery such as vertebral 
body tethering (VBT) are growing in popularity. There is limited data evaluating 
motion preserving after the different tether approaches. We hypothesized that 
spinal motion would be preserved in both the sagittal and coronal planes in 
patients after thoracic, lumbar, and bilateral vertebral body tethering 
procedures.
METHODS: This was a retrospective comparison study of adolescent idiopathic 
scoliosis (AIS) patients who underwent VBT. Preoperative and postoperative 
coronal range of motion across the instrumented levels were compared using a 
standing microdose slot-scanning protocol. Flexion/extension radiographs were 
evaluated postoperatively to assess preserved sagittal arc of motion. Patients 
with known cord breakage were excluded.
RESULTS: The mean age at surgery was 12.9 years (range: 9.4 to 16.5) with mean 
follow-up period of 2.8 years. Skeletal maturity, defined as Risser sign ≥5, was 
observed in 29 patients. (26.9%). Overall, mean thoracic coronal arc of motion 
for postoperative VBT patients was 10 degrees in the thoracic spine and 20 
degrees in the lumbar. This was a 59% (24 to 10 deg.) decrease in thoracic range 
of motion and a 51% (40 to 20 deg.) decrease in lumbar range of motion. 
Right-sided motion was greater in patients with thoracic instrumentation, 
whereas left-sided motion was greater in patients with lumbar instrumentation. 
In addition, patients also retained sagittal motion. Patients with single 
thoracic tethers had a total arc of motion of 22 degrees, whereas patients with 
single lumbar tethers had a total arc of motion of 25 degrees. It was noted that 
both groups had a greater degree of flexion than extension.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with single thoracic tethers saw a 60% decrease in the 
total coronal arc of motion. Patients with single lumbar tethers saw a 57% 
decrease in coronal motion. Patients had around 20 to 25-degree arc of motion 
preserved over the instrumented segments in the sagittal plane. Further work is 
needed to outline the functional benefits of motion preservation after VBT.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III (retrospective cohort study).

The Evolving Treatment Landscape for the Elderly Multiple Myeloma Patient: From 
Quad Regimens to T-Cell Engagers and CAR-T.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is predominantly a disease of the elderly. In recent 
years, a surge of highly effective plasma cell therapies has revolutionized the 
care of elderly multiple myeloma (MM) patients, for whom frailty and age-related 
competing causes of mortality determine management. Traditionally, the treatment 
of newly diagnosed elderly patients has centered on doublet or triplet 
combinations composed of immunomodulators (IMIDs), proteasome inhibitors (PIs), 
anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and corticosteroids producing median 
progression-free survival (PFS) rates between 34 and 62 months. However, 
recently, a series of large phase III clinical trials examining quadruplet 
regimens of PIs, IMIDs, corticosteroids, and anti-CD38 mAbs have shown 
exceptional outcomes, with median PFS exceeding 60 months, albeit with higher 
rates of peripheral neuropathy (≥Grade 2: 27% vs. 10%) when PIs and IMIDs are 
combined, and infections (≥Grade 3: 40% vs. 29-41%) with the addition of 
anti-CD38mAbs. The development of T-cell redirecting therapies including T-cell 
engagers (TCEs) and CAR-T cells has further expanded the therapeutic arsenal. 
TCEs have shown exceptional activity in relapsed disease and are being explored 
in the newly diagnosed setting with promising early results. However, concerns 
remain regarding the logistical challenges of step-up dosing, which often 
necessitates inpatient admission, the infectious risks, and the financial burden 
associated with TCEs in elderly patients. CAR-T, the most potent commercially 
available therapy for MM, offers the potential of a 'one and done' approach. 
However, its application to elderly patients has been tempered by significant 
concerns of cytokine release syndrome, early and delayed neurological toxicity, 
and its overall tolerability in frail patients. Robust data in frail patients 
are still needed. How CAR-T and TCEs will be sequenced among the growing 
therapeutic armamentarium for elderly MM patients remains to be determined. This 
review explores the safety, efficacy, cost, and logistical barriers associated 
with the above treatments in elderly MM patients.

OBJECTIVE: Present the rationale for the development of a new, patient-facing 
vital sign for adult hearing.
STUDY DESIGN: Structured A3 process.
SETTING: Fourteen virtual meetings and two in-person meetings held between May 
2021 and June 2022.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification and refinement of a countermeasure to 
develop and imbed a hearing health vital sign for adult hearing.
RESULTS: Through a rigorous, structured A3 process, the Hearing Health 
Collaborative identified and refined the rationale for and the qualities 
associated with a public-facing vital sign for adult hearing loss. Specifically, 
such a vital sign must embody five qualities: simple, accessible, stable, 
inclusive, and meaningful. These qualities together would ensure that a hearing 
health vital sign would be useful not only as a screening tool but also as an 
instrument to guide next steps in workup and potentially treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Successful identification and implementation of a hearing metric or 
"vital sign" for the presence of adult hearing loss, using precedent convention 
of other medical diseases, may help reframe public perceptions surrounding 
hearing loss, improve awareness and literacy regarding the presence of the 
disease, and prompt action to seek diagnostic assessment.

BACKGROUND: Patients with lung disease, sleep apnea, and chronic thromboemboli 
can develop pulmonary hypertension, currently classified as group 3 or 4. Many 
of these patients also have risk factors for heart failure with preserved 
ejection fraction (HFpEF), but the optimal approach to identify the disease 
overlap remains unclear.
METHODS: Pretest probability for HFpEF was determined using the HFpEF-ABA (age, 
body mass index, atrial fibrillation) algorithm among adjudicated group 3 or 4 
patients at risk for pulmonary hypertension in the PVDOMICS study (Redefining 
Pulmonary Hypertension Through Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics). Patients 
were stratified by current resting right heart catheterization criteria, and in 
a separate analysis, stratified only by HFpEF-ABA probability into low (<25%), 
intermediate, and high (≥75%) HFpEF probability groups.
RESULTS: Among 598 patients with group 3 disease, 27% (n=161) had elevated 
pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with postcapillary pulmonary 
hypertension even at rest, which was associated with the highest exercise PCWP. 
However, regardless of this resting PCWP-based classification, a larger subset 
had intermediate-to-high HFpEF-ABA probabilities (32% [n=197] high and 57% 
[n=358] intermediate HFpEF probability). High HFpEF probability in group 3 
disease was associated with higher resting and dynamic PCWP response to NO, 
fluid, and exercise (P<0.0001 for all). These changes were comparable with more 
traditionally defined HFpEF without pulmonary vascular disease (n=61) but less 
severe than those with combined precapillary and postcapillary pulmonary 
hypertension HFpEF (n=31; interaction P=0.006). Increasing HFpEF probability in 
group 3 disease was associated with worse left heart remodeling, quality of 
life, 6-minute walk distance, and peak VO2 (P<0.0001 for all). Findings were 
replicated in group 4 disease (n=102).
CONCLUSIONS: Quantifying pretest probability for HFpEF in patients with sleep 
apnea, lung disease, or chronic thromboemboli identifies a progressive gradient 
for dynamic PCWP abnormalities with worse functional status and quality of life. 
These subclinical left heart abnormalities are not universally detectable by 
resting right heart catheterization alone and call for further study of whether 
strategies to prevent or treat HFpEF might improve functional status in these 
patients with high risk of occult HFpEF.

BACKGROUND: The angiographic shape of an occlusion, like the clot meniscus sign 
and the claw sign, has been reported to potentially impact the recanalization 
rate and clinical outcome in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for 
acute ischemic strokes.
METHOD: Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature search was 
conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science databases. Patients 
were grouped into clot meniscus/claw sign positive and negative groups based on 
the definitions obtained from each study. Primary outcomes included technical 
success, with a meta-analysis performed using a random-effects model to 
calculate proportions and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (Cl).
RESULTS: We included seven studies recruiting 1572 patients. The results 
indicated that the positive and negative groups had comparable first-pass effect 
(OR 1.95; 95% CI 0.76 to 5.01; P=0.167) and final recanalization (OR 1.36; 95% 
CI 0.81 to 2.27; P=0.248) rates. However, the rate of having a favorable 
functional outcome was significantly higher in the positive group than in the 
negative sign group (OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.92; P<0.003). Within the 
sign-positive population, the use of contact aspiration was associated with a 
significantly higher rate of recanalization compared with using a stent 
retriever (OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.49; P<0.001). This result did not translate 
into a clinical impact, as both stent retriever and contact aspiration showed 
comparable rates of functional independence at 3 months (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.02 to 
2.33; P=0.210).
CONCLUSION: The presence of the clot meniscus/claw sign is not associated with 
recanalization outcomes after thrombectomy. However, it might be a good sign to 
predict which thrombectomy technique might be associated with better 
recanalization, although current evidence may need further confirmation.

BACKGROUND: Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a 
functional imaging modality that can quantify tissue permeability and blood 
flow. Due to vasculature changes resulting from radiation therapy (RT), DCE-MRI 
quantitative parameters should be significantly different in regions receiving a 
high radiation dose compared to regions receiving a low radiation dose. This 
work sought to determine if a significant difference exists in post head and 
neck cancer (HNC)-RT DCE-MRI quantitative parameters Ktrans and ve between 
regions of the mandible receiving a high radiation dose and regions of the 
mandible receiving a low radiation dose.
METHODS: DCE-MRI was acquired from HNC subjects post-RT. The DCE-MRI 
quantitative parameters Ktrans and ve were obtained through Tofts model fitting. 
Four mandible sections (left ramus, left body, right ramus, and right body) were 
delineated on subject mandible contours. Two Kruskal-Wallis tests comparing the 
mean Ktrans and ve in low dose (≤ 60 Gy) areas of the four mandible regions were 
computed. Next, two Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine if the 
means of Ktrans and ve between high dose (> 60 Gy) and low dose (≤ 60 Gy) 
mandible regions were significantly different. To account for multiple 
statistical tests, a Bonferroni corrected significance level for all statistical 
tests was used (α = 0.05/4 = 0.0125) .
RESULTS: 48 HNC subjects were included in the analysis. The Kruskal-Wallis tests 
showed no inherent significant difference in Ktrans means between mandible 
regions ( χ(3)2 = 5.61 , p=0.13) and no inherent significant difference in ve 
means between mandible regions ( χ(3)2 = 0.92 , p=0.82). No significant 
difference was found between high and low dose Ktrans mandible means (W=392, 
p=0.044). A significant difference was found between high and low dose ve 
mandible means (W=214, p=0.00013).
CONCLUSIONS: No inherent difference in DCE-MRI quantitative parameters was 
observed within subject mandibles, but a significant difference was observed 
between ve means of high and low radiation dose mandible regions. These results 
provide evidence of the utility of DCE-MRI to monitor mandible vasculature 
changes resulting from head and neck cancer radiation therapy. Monitoring post 
HNC-RT mandible vasculature changes is important to initiate earlier toxicity 
management and ultimately improve HNC survivor quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer care has become increasingly complex, lending itself 
to fellowship-based specialization. However, breast surgery expertise remains 
central to general surgery training. We hypothesized that residents entering 
breast surgical oncology (BSO) fellowship have more exposure to breast surgery 
and log a higher number of breast cases compared with all other graduating 
residents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographics, program characteristics, and Accreditation 
Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) case logs were collected for 
graduates from 20 general surgery residency programs in the US Resident 
OPerative Experience (ROPE) Consortium from 2010 to 2020. BSO fellowship 
matriculants (BSO group) were compared to those entering other surgical 
fellowships or general surgery practice (non-BSO group).
RESULTS: Among 1343 graduates, 45 (3.4%) matriculated into BSO fellowship. BSO 
matriculants were more often female (89% versus 34%, p < 0.0001). Demographic, 
program, and institutional variables were otherwise similar (all p > 0.05). 
The BSO group logged fewer total procedures (median, 976 versus 1039), 
consistent across Surgeon Junior and Teaching Assistant roles and multiple 
operative domains, including alimentary tract, pediatric, plastics, thoracic, 
trauma, and vascular (all p < 0.05). However, BSO group logged more breast cases 
(74 versus 50, p < 0.0001), despite comparable access to a breast surgery 
rotation (64% versus 64%) and fellowship-trained faculty (82% versus 84%; both 
p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Future BSO matriculants performed 50% more breast cases during 
residency but logged fewer total cases across multiple operative domains. These 
residents may develop early interest in breast surgery and subsequently tailor 
their training. Further mixed-methods studies are needed to understand these 
findings and their implications for trainees pursuing breast surgery.

Teclistamab is an anti-CD3-/B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) bispecific antibody 
approved for use in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We undertook a 
retrospective study of postapproval, real-world outcomes with teclistamab in the 
US Multiple Myeloma Immunotherapy Consortium. Among 509 patients, 89% would have 
been ineligible for the MajesTEC-1 trial, primarily due to prior BCMA-directed 
therapy, cytopenias, or diminished performance status. Cytokine release syndrome 
occurred in 54% (1.4% grade ≥3) and immune effector cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome in 11% (2.2% grade ≥3), with no fatal events. Infections 
occurred in 42% and contributed to death in 5%. Partial response (PR) or better 
was achieved in 53% and very good PR or better in 45%. With 10.1 months of 
median follow-up, the estimated median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.8 
months and 12-month overall survival was 61%. Independent predictors of less 
than very good PR and shorter PFS included BCMA-directed chimeric antigen 
receptor T-cell therapy in the previous 9 months, high disease burden, 
lymphopenia, and elevated ferritin.
SIGNIFICANCE: T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies such as teclistamab 
represent an important new treatment modality for multiple myeloma and other 
blood cancers. This study evaluates the real-world safety and efficacy of 
teclistamab, including its activity in populations not represented in the 
initial phase I/II study, and identifies clinical variables associated with 
treatment response.

PURPOSE: To investigate the complexities of covering study-recommended medical 
care costs for individuals (in order to prevent lack of adherence due to 
financial reasons), which have received little attention.
METHODS: We explored the deliberations, decisions, and challenges faced by the 
Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network during the 
implementation of a genomic research project recommending clinical care based on 
high-risk results defined largely by polygenic risk scores. Two surveys were 
disseminated to eMERGE sites: to identify preferences about payment for specific 
care recommendations (survey 1) and to understand the operational processes of 
covering medical care costs (survey 2).
RESULTS: Paying for a subset of care recommendations for the funded study 
duration was identified as the most feasible approach for covering medical care 
costs for participants who received high-risk genomic results. Each eMERGE site, 
by necessity, used diverse approaches to pay for medical care costs.
CONCLUSION: eMERGE researchers balanced competing concerns about bias, equity, 
study design, regulatory compliance, and cost in designing a unified approach to 
cover some of the recommended medical care costs in the study. Many 
implementation challenges were encountered. Findings can inform researchers and 
regulatory bodies about the implications and complications of covering medical 
care costs in translational research studies focused on prevention.

Tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) is a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor T-cell 
therapy for relapsed/refractory precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(R/R B-ALL). We report infectious complications through 100 days (D100) 
following tisa-cel therapy in 471 pediatric and young adults (median age 13.8 
years) with R/R B-ALL reported from September 2017 to June 2022. By D100, 137 
(29%) patients had an infectious event with an infection density of 0.542 per 
100 person-days at risk. D100 cumulative incidences of bacterial, viral, and 
fungal infections were 14.1%, 11.6%, and 1.3%, corresponding to infection 
density scores of 0.296, 0.213, and 0.033 per 100 person-days at risk, 
respectively. In multivariable analysis, receipt of ≥3 lines of therapy prior to 
tisa-cel (hazard ratio [HR] 1.86, 95% CI 1.13-3.08, p=0.015), any grade cytokine 
release syndrome (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.17-2.71, p=0.007), and lack of neutrophil 
recovery (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.47-4.69, p=0.001) were associated with an increased 
risk for any infection. Similar associations were observed for bacterial 
infections with the addition of younger age as an adverse risk (<6 vs. 6-15 
years HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.23-4.61, p=0.01). Risk factors for viral infections 
included increasing age (1-year increase HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09, p=0.016), 
prior history of any infection (HR 2.76, 95% CI 1.40-5.46, p=0.004), and prior 
hematopoietic cell transplant (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.18-3.71, p=0.011). D100 
infection-related mortality (IRM) rate was low at 0.2% (95% CI 0.0-0.8%). In 
this multicenter real-world study, we observed a high incidence of infectious 
complications but a low IRM following tisa-cel for R/R B-ALL.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is invariably associated with a JAK2 mutation, with over 
50% of patients harboring additional non-JAK2 mutations. In the current study, 
319 patients with PV underwent NGS at diagnosis or in chronic phase PV (Group A: 
N = 270, 85%) or at the time of fibrotic (Group B; N = 37, 12%) or leukemic 
(Group C; N = 12, 4%) transformation. Mutational frequencies involving 
TP53/SRSF2/IDH1/U2AF1 were significantly (p < 0.05) different between patients 
in the mutually exclusive Groups A (2%/4%/2%/0.4%), B (8%/0%/0%/5%), and C 
(50%/25%/17%/8%). Analyses on phenotype/genotype associations and prognostic 
impact on overall (OS), leukemia-free (LFS), and myelofibrosis-free (MFFS) 
survival were limited to Group A patients. ASXL1MUT was associated with younger 
age (p < 0.01), SRSF2MUT with older age and leukocytosis (p < 0.01), and TP53MUT 
with leukocytosis (p < 0.01). Mutation co-segregation was apparent between ASXL1 
and IDH2 (p < 0.01) or SRSF2 (p < 0.01), SRSF2 and IDH2 (p < 0.01), and TP53 and 
NRAS (p = 0.01). Multivariable analysis identified SRSF2MUT (p < 0.01; HR, 4.2, 
1.9-9.5), IDH2MUT (p = 0.01; HR, 5.3, 1.8-15.3), ASXL1MUT (p = 0.04; HR, 2.0, 
1.1-3.7), leukocyte count ≥ 15 × 109/L (p < 0.01; HR 2.0, 1.3-3.1), and advanced 
age (p < 0.01) as risk factors for OS. Median OS in the presence (N = 235; 87%) 
or absence (N = 35; 13%) of any adverse mutation (i.e., SRSF2MUT, ASXL1MUT, or 
IDH2MUT) was 8.8 versus 17.8 years (p = 0.01; HR 1.8, 1.1-2.9). In addition, 
ASXL1MUT (p = 0.02; HR, 1.6-24.9), SRSF2MUT (p = 0.06; HR, 11.9, 1.1-126.2), and 
advanced age (p = 0.04) were associated with inferior LFS, and SRSF2MUT 
(p < 0.01; HR, 24.0, 5.5-103.8) and abnormal karyotype (p < 0.01; HR 3.8, 
1.6-8.9) with inferior MFFS. The number of non-JAK2 mutations was significant in 
predicting outcome in univariate but not multivariable analysis. The 
observations from the current study highlight the prognostic significance of 
non-JAK2 mutations in PV and the prospect of their inclusion in future 
prognostic models.

IMPORTANCE: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are associated 
with increased risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and nonarteritic anterior 
ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). The risk of sight-threatening complications 
associated with GLP-1 RAs is underexamined.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the use of GLP-1 RAs in patients with T2D is 
associated with the development of DR, NAION, or DR complications.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study of adults 
(aged ≥18 years) with T2D and a recent hemoglobin A1c level of 6.5% or higher 
was conducted between January 1, 2015, and September 30, 2022, using the TriNetX 
database. The cohort was divided into 2 groups, adjusted for baseline 
characteristics through propensity score matching (PSM), based on whether the 
individuals received prescriptions for a GLP-1 RA. The statistical analysis was 
conducted on October 10, 2024.
EXPOSURES: At least 2 prescriptions of a GLP-1 RA given 6 months apart.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cox proportional hazard regression models were used 
to evaluate the primary outcome: association between GLP-1 RAs and the risk of 
incident DR, NAION, or sight-threatening complications over a 2-year follow-up 
period.
RESULTS: After PSM, 185 066 individuals (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [12.5] years; 93 
389 females [50.5%]) were prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists. Use of GLP-1 RAs 
was associated with an increased incidence of DR (hazard ratio [HR], 1.07; 95% 
CI, 1.03-1.11), while no statistically significant difference was observed in 
the risk of NAION (HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.94-1.70). In a subgroup analysis of 
32 695 patients with preexisting DR, GLP-1 RAs were not associated with 
progression to proliferative DR (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.97-1.15) or diabetic 
macular edema (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95-1.01) but were associated with a lower 
occurrence of vitreous hemorrhages (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.68-0.80), neovascular 
glaucoma (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68-0.88), or blindness (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 
0.73-0.82).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of individuals with T2D, GLP-1 
RA use was associated with a modestly increased risk of incident DR; however, 
fewer patients experienced sight-threatening DR complications, including 
blindness, even among those with preexisting DR. These findings suggest that all 
patients with T2D treated with GLP-1 RAs, regardless of preexisting DR, should 
be regularly screened and monitored for potential complications of T2D.

BACKGROUND: The REgistry of Flow and Perfusion Imaging for Artificial 
Intelligence with PET (REFINE PET) was established to collect multicenter PET 
and associated computed tomography (CT) images, together with clinical data and 
outcomes, into a comprehensive research resource. REFINE PET will enable 
validation and development of both standard and novel cardiac PET/CT processing 
methods.
METHODS: REFINE PET is a multicenter, international registry that contains both 
clinical and imaging data. The PET scans were processed using QPET software 
(Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA), while the CT scans were 
processed using deep learning (DL) to detect coronary artery calcium (CAC). 
Patients were followed up for the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular 
events (MACE), which include death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and 
late revascularization (>90 days from PET).
RESULTS: The REFINE PET registry currently contains data for 35,588 patients 
from 14 sites, with additional patient data and sites anticipated. Comprehensive 
clinical data (including demographics, medical history, and stress test results) 
were integrated with more than 2200 imaging variables across 42 categories. The 
registry is poised to address a broad range of clinical questions, supported by 
correlating invasive angiography (within 6 months of MPI) in 5972 patients and a 
total of 9252 major adverse cardiovascular events during a median follow-up of 
4.2 years.
CONCLUSION: The REFINE PET registry leverages the integration of clinical, 
multimodality imaging, and novel quantitative and AI tools to advance the role 
of PET/CT MPI in diagnosis and risk stratification.

In high-performing health care institutions, delivering high-quality care and 
ensuring patient safety are core priorities. The transformation of health care 
using quality and safety end points is driven by a commitment to 
patient-centered care, continuous improvement, and innovation. Mayo Clinic 
prioritizes this approach through an integrated multispecialty model that aligns 
disciplines, fosters collaboration, and embeds quality into daily practice. This 
article explores the fundamental principles that guide health care 
transformation, including the utilization of diverse quality measures, the 
development of a comprehensive, enterprise-wide Quality Assurance and Practice 
Improvement plan, and the implementation of a learning health system. By 
focusing on structural, process, outcome, and patient experience measures, as 
well as staff engagement and real-time data monitoring, health care institutions 
can sustain a culture of safety and achieve high-reliability performance. 
Additionally, ongoing education, leadership engagement, and the use of 
innovative tools like e-learning and virtual reality simulations further enhance 
safety outcomes. Through these initiatives, health care institutions can 
continually advance their mission to provide world-class health care.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The APOE (apolipoprotein E) ε4 allele is the 
strongest known genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and for 
brain amyloidosis, an early marker of disease pathophysiology. However, APOE ε4 
is present in only 25% of the general population and is by itself inadequate for 
explaining susceptibility to amyloid accumulation or AD diagnosis. Existing 
studies have been limited by potential confounding due to inclusion of 
individuals carrying APOE ε4 or ε2 (which has a modest protective association). 
We hypothesized that genome-wide association study (GWAS) and genetic risk score 
(GRS) analyses in APOE ε3/ε3 individuals would uniquely identify novel 
predictors of β-amyloid pathology in older adults.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA), 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and Rush Religious Orders 
Study and Memory and Aging Project. Frequency of APOE ε3/ε3 in those samples 
ranged from 48% to 61%. A GWAS was performed across 1,496 individuals with 
amyloid PET to identify candidate variants for GRS generation. Postmortem 
neuropathologic data (N = 710) were used to refine the variant list to capture 
high-likelihood true associations. An independent sample (N = 641) with plasma 
p-tau181 data was used for validation.
RESULTS: The GWAS identified previously implicated (e.g., PICALM and RBFOX1) and 
novel potential associations with amyloid PET burden. A non-APOE GRS of top 
variants was strongly associated with amyloid PET levels in the MCSA (p = 4.34 × 
10-9, β = 5.88) and ADNI (p = 1.87 × 10-8, β = 12.1) cohorts. In both cohorts, 
this non-APOE amyloid GRS outperformed a comparator GRS (based on variants 
associated with clinically diagnosed AD dementia risk) in explaining phenotypic 
variation. The non-APOE amyloid GRS was also associated with postmortem 
neuropathologic β-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle burden and in an 
independent sample was associated with plasma p-tau181 concentrations (a robust 
indicator of cerebral amyloidosis).
DISCUSSION: Our non-APOE amyloid GRS, which appropriately includes variants 
associated with amyloid deposition in APOE ɛ4/ɛ2 noncarriers, may advance 
personalized prediction of genetic susceptibility to β-amyloid accumulation 
within the large segment of the population that is APOE ε3/ε3. This may have 
future implications for risk modification, trial enrollment, and treatment 
selection.

BACKGROUND: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological cancer in 
high-income countries. In addition to environmental risk factors, genetic 
predisposition contributes towards endometrial cancer development but is still 
incompletely defined.
METHODS: Building on genome-wide association studies (GWASs) by the Endometrial 
Cancer Association Consortium, we conducted a GWAS meta-analysis of 17,278 
endometrial cancer cases and 289,180 controls, incorporating biobank samples 
from the UK, Finland, Estonia and Japan.
FINDINGS: GWAS analysis identified five additional risk loci (3p25.2, 3q25.2, 
6q22.31, 12q21.2, and 17q24.2). Corresponding gene-based analyses supported 
findings for three of the five loci, at NAV3 (12q21.2), PPARG (3p25.2), and BPTF 
(17q24.2), as well as two additional candidate risk regions at ATF7IP2 
(16p13.2-p13.13) and RPP21 (6p22.1). Validation genotyping in further 
independent case-control series replicated the most significant locus at 12q21.2 
and corroborated risk variants located intronic to NAV3, the gene for Neuron 
Navigator 3. Downregulation of NAV3 in endometrial cell lines accelerated cell 
division and wound healing capacity whereas NAV3 overexpression reduced cell 
survival and increased cell death, indicating that NAV3 acts as a tumour 
suppressor in endometrial cells.
INTERPRETATION: Our large study extends the number of genome-wide significant 
risk loci identified for endometrial carcinoma by about one-third and proposes a 
role of NAV3 as a tumour suppressor in this common cancer.
FUNDING: This study was mainly supported by funding from the Wilhelm Sander 
Foundation, Germany, and the National Health and Medical Research Council 
(NHMRC) of Australia. A complete list of funding organisations is provided in

Histoplasmosis has a wide spectrum of presentations ranging from mild pulmonary 
disease to a more widespread infection leading to disseminated histoplasmosis. 
Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis is a rare form of disseminated histoplasmosis 
that most commonly causes nonspecific symptoms and rarely presents with serious 
symptoms. Duodenal involvement is further rare but can cause ulcerated lesions 
leading to upper gastrointestinal bleed. The potential for a nonspecific initial 
presentation quickly progressing to a fatal upper gastrointestinal bleed makes 
it important to keep Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis in our list of 
differentials, as timely initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy can 
significantly reduce the risk of severe complications and mortality.

Cancer Center, Houston, TX (A.A.).

Primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) is an uncommon 
inflammatory vasculitis restricted to the brain, spinal cord, and/or the 
leptomeninges. While typically bilateral, a rare subset presents with strictly 
unilateral involvement. This variant remains underrecognized and is often 
misdiagnosed as glioma, demyelination, or chronic encephalitis due to 
overlapping clinical and imaging features.Unilateral PACNS (U-PACNS) may 
manifest as tumor-like solitary or multifocal lesions, infarcts, or hemorrhages. 
Imaging, including vessel wall imaging (VWI), perfusion and spectroscopy may 
demonstrate underlying abnormalities but are often non-specific. 
Histopathologically, most cases show small-to medium-vessel lymphocytic 
vasculitis, in contrast to granulomatous inflammation which is more common in 
bilateral disease. Diagnosis is challenging, particularly in 
angiography-negative presentations, and often relies on excluding systemic, 
infectious, and neoplastic mimics.Recognition of U-PACNS is critical, as timely 
immunosuppressive therapy can avoid misdiagnosis, alter disease course and 
prevent irreversible deficits. The authors found 49 reported cases of U-PACNS in 
the English literature. Herein, we present a review of this rare and 
underrecognized entity, outlining key imaging features, and pertinent 
differentials that may help with a more accurate and timely non-invasive 
diagnosis.ABBREVIATIONS: U-PACNS＝ Unilateral Primary Angiitis of the Central 
Nervous System; CSF=Cerebrospinal Fluid; TLM= Tumor-like Mass;

Radiomics has emerged as a promising non-invasive imaging approach in pediatric 
neuro-oncology, offering the ability to extract high-dimensional quantitative 
features from routine MRI to support diagnosis, risk stratification, molecular 
characterization, and outcome prediction. Pediatric brain tumors, which differ 
significantly from adult tumors in biology and imaging appearance, present 
unique diagnostic and prognostic challenges. By integrating radiomics with 
machine learning algorithms, studies have demonstrated strong performance in 
classifying tumor types such as medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and gliomas, and 
predicting molecular subgroups and mutations such as H3K27M and BRAF. Recent 
studies combining radiomics with machine learning algorithms - including support 
vector machines, random forests, and deep learning CNNs - have demonstrated 
promising performance, with AUCs ranging from 0.75 to 0.98 for tumor 
classification and 0.77 to 0.88 for molecular subgroup prediction, across 
cohorts from 50 to over 450 patients, with internal cross-validation and 
external validation in some cases. In resource-limited settings or regions with 
limited radiologist manpower, radiomics-based tools could help augment 
diagnostic accuracy and consistency, serving as decision support to prioritize 
patients for further evaluation or biopsy. Emerging applications such as 
radio-immunomics and radio-pathomics may further enhance understanding of tumor 
biology but remain investigational. Despite its potential, clinical translation 
faces notable barriers, including limited pediatric-specific datasets, variable 
imaging protocols, and the lack of standardized, reproducible workflows. 
Multi-institutional collaboration, harmonized pipelines, and prospective 
validation are essential next steps. Radiomics should be viewed as a 
supplementary tool that complements existing clinical and pathological 
frameworks, supporting more informed and equitable care in pediatric brain tumor 
management.

BACKGROUND: Medical graduates serve as forefront of healthcare workforce, and 
their knowledge and practices regarding voluntary blood donation (VBD) can 
significantly influence the future approach to blood donation and transfusion in 
the general population. This cross-sectional survey aims to evaluate the 
awareness and attitudes regarding VBD in the medical graduates and residents 
across multiple healthcare disciplines (allopathy, ayurveda and homeopathy). It 
also aims to evaluate the sociodemographic factors that may secondarily 
influence VBD in this subpopulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was conducted over a 6-month 
period across 2 allopathic (government and municipal), 1 homeopathic and 1 
ayurvedic hospitals and included medical interns and residents at these 
institutions. Data was collected electronically using Google Forms™ and results 
were analyzed using SPSS version 25 (IBM, New York, USA).
RESULTS: Data collected from 416 medical graduates (48.8 % allopathy, 31.3 % 
homeopathy, 20 % ayurveda), revealed that while 98.8 % recognized blood donation 
as essential, only 39.2 % donated regularly. Key barriers included perceived 
unfitness (30 %) and fear of needles (4.8 %). Awareness gaps were evident, with 
only 47.4 % receiving formal training and 57.5 % unaware of rare donor 
registries. Gender differences showed males donated more frequently (65.6 % vs. 
40.5 %, p < 0.0005).
CONCLUSION: Medical graduates across all healthcare disciplines face gaps in 
knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding VBD, driven by misconceptions and 
limited training. Targeted education and institutional support are vital to 
enable them as advocates and active participants in sustaining blood donation 
efforts within the general population.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a cornerstone of neuroimaging, providing 
unparalleled soft-tissue contrast. However, its clinical utility is often 
limited by long acquisition times, which contribute to motion artifacts, patient 
discomfort, and increased costs. Although traditional acceleration techniques, 
such as parallel imaging and compressed sensing help reduce scan times, they may 
reduce signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and introduce artifacts. The advent of deep 
learning-based image reconstruction (DLBIR) may help in several ways to reduce 
scan times while preserving or improving image quality. Various DLBIR techniques 
are currently available through different vendors, with claimed reductions in 
gradient times up to 85% while maintaining or enhancing lesion conspicuity, 
improved noise suppression and diagnostic accuracy. The evolution of DLBIR from 
2D to 3D acquisitions, coupled with advancements in self-supervised learning, 
further expands its capabilities and clinical applicability. Despite these 
advancements, challenges persist in generalizability across scanners and imaging 
conditions, susceptibility to artifacts and potential alterations in pathology 
representation. Additionally, limited data on training, underlying algorithms 
and clinical validation of these vendor-specific closed-source algorithms pose 
barriers to end-user trust and widespread adoption. This review explores the 
current applications of DLBIR in neuroimaging, vendor-driven implementations, 
and emerging trends that may impact accelerated MRI acquisitions.ABBREVIATIONS:

Version 9 of the AJCC staging system for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 
introduces important refinements, emphasizing improved prognostic accuracy, 
clarity, and clinical relevance. Building on the 8th edition, it refines TNM 
classifications to address limitations in survival outcome stratification and 
incorporates new criteria. Specifically, version 9 clarifies the criteria for T3 
disease by requiring unequivocal evidence of bone involvement-namely, 
involvement of the skull base (including the pterygoid plates), cervical 
vertebrae, or paranasal sinuses. It additionally introduces advanced radiologic 
extranodal extension as a criterion for the N3 category and subdivides M1 
disease into M1a disease (three or fewer metastatic lesions) and M1b disease 
(more than three metastatic lesions) to enhance risk stratification. Developed 
through extensive multicenter studies and validated by international panels, 
version 9 redefines NPC stage groups, aligning clinical management with 
evidence-based practices and improving prognostic accuracy. This Review 
highlights the key modifications in version 9 that are relevant to radiologists, 
providing imaging examples and considering implications for clinical practice, 
prognosis, and treatment planning.

Determining volume status at the bedside is an essential skill clinicians must 
possess. Unfortunately, traditional bedside assessments, including measuring 
vital signs, obtaining a history, and performing a physical examination, are 
often unreliable and limited by patient body habitus. Point-of-care ultrasound 
(POCUS) is a valuable and accurate adjunct to aid in determination of a 
patient's volume status. POCUS of the lungs, heart, inferior vena cava, and 
internal jugular vein can add valuable data for clinicians when determining 
volume status. Specifically, lung ultrasound is more accurate than physical 
examination and chest radiography in detecting pulmonary edema and pleural 
effusions; cardiac POCUS allows for qualitative estimations of left ventricle 
and right ventricle function and can confirm the presence or absence of 
clinically significant pericardial effusions; and POCUS of the inferior vena 
cava and internal jugular vein can estimate right atrial pressure, and in the 
appropriate clinical context, help to determine intravascular volume status.

Pavlovian fear conditioning is a fundamental process in both health and disease. 
We investigate its neural correlates and sources of variability using harmonized 
functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 2199 individuals across nine 
countries, including 1888 healthy individuals and 311 with anxiety-related or 
depressive disorders. Using mega-analysis and normative modeling, we show that 
fear conditioning consistently engages brain regions within the "central 
autonomic-interoceptive" or "salience" network. Several task variables strongly 
modulate activity in these regions, contributing to variability in neural 
responses. Additionally, brain activation patterns differ between healthy 
individuals and those with anxiety-related or depressive disorders, with 
distinct profiles characterizing specific disorders such as post-traumatic 
stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. While the neural correlates 
of fear conditioning are highly generalizable at the population level, 
variability arises from differences in task design and clinical status, 
highlighting the importance of methodological diversity in capturing fear 
learning mechanisms.

OBJECTIVES: Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) provides multiple quantitative 
biomarkers for assessing chronic liver disease. This study evaluated the 
prognostic value of MRE-based long-term liver stiffness (LS) changes in chronic 
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and explored short-term viscosity changes 
(loss modulus, LM) for monitoring responses to direct-acting antiviral treatment 
(DAA-Tx).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-nine adults were included. We 
retrospectively analyzed 138 HCV participants with at least two 2D MREs, 
defining progression as an LS increase ΔLS ≥ 19% above baseline (LSB), 
predicting liver-related events (LREs) with Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox 
proportional hazards regression. We also prospectively analyzed 21 participants, 
11 of whom underwent DAA-Tx and ten healthy controls. Dual-frequency 3D 
MRE-derived LS, LM, and damping ratio (DR) were compared at five time points 
during DAA-Tx.
RESULTS: Among the 138 HCVs, 38 (27.5%) were progressors, with a 
ΔLS = 0.393 kPa/year; 11 developed LREs, showing a steeper rise of 
0.614 kPa/year. LSB and the combination of LSB and ΔLS were significantly 
associated with LREs. Specifically, each 1 kPa increase in LSB was associated 
with doubled risk of developing LREs [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 2.05; 
C-statistic = 0.831, p < 0.001]. The combination of LSB and ΔLS further improved 
predictive performance (aHR = 2.92; C-statistic = 0.883, p < 0.001). Progressors 
had a hazard ratio (HR) of 15.44 for developing cirrhosis (p < 0.001). LS 
decreased post-DAA-Tx, while LM initially increased (p < 0.05) and normalized by 
12 months post-DAA-Tx.
CONCLUSIONS: Two-dimensional MRE-assessed longitudinal change in LS can predict 
future clinical events in HCV patients, providing better risk stratification 
than LS alone. Multiparametric dual-frequency 3D MRE has promise for short-term 
changes in treatment effects.
KEY POINTS: Question Accurately predicting clinical outcomes and monitoring 
direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment efficacy in HCV patients remains an 
unmet need. Findings Longitudinal LS changes predict future clinical events in 
HCV patients. Multiparametric dual-frequency 3D MRE detects short-term 
inflammatory and treatment-related changes, enhancing disease monitoring. 
Clinical relevance This study demonstrates longitudinal MRE as a reliable 
follow-up tool for chronic liver disease, enabling outcome prediction, risk 
stratification, and treatment monitoring, advancing personalized, non-invasive 
management for HCV patients.

BACKGROUND: Although most transplant centers preferentially offer minimally 
invasive approaches to donor nephrectomies, there remains less standardization 
specific to the kidney extraction site. This study aimed to evaluate incisional 
hernia occurrence in living kidney donors based on kidney extraction site 
location.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of all donors who underwent 
minimally invasive living donor nephrectomies at the Mayo Clinic Arizona between 
2011 and 2023 with a 2-year external validation cohort from Mayo Clinic Florida 
and Mayo Clinic Minnesota. The cohort was divided into 2 groups based on the 
kidney extraction site type: midline infraumbilical and Pfannenstiel.
RESULTS: In the primary cohort, incisional hernia occurrence was observed in 
1.2% of donors with an infraumbilical midline kidney extraction site compared 
with 0.1% with a Pfannenstiel extraction site (p = 0.04). Donors with an 
infraumbilical midline kidney extraction site were more likely to be men (50.8% 
vs 23.3%, p < 0.0001), have a higher BMI (mean 27.2 vs 26 kg/m 2 , p < 0.0001), 
and have current or former tobacco use (p = 0.002). There were no differences in 
incisional hernia occurrence when comparing minimally invasive surgical 
techniques (p = 0.52). In the external validation cohort, hernia occurrence was 
observed in 4.5% of donors with a midline incision compared with 0.0% with a 
Pfannenstiel incision (p = 0.09). Using combined data from the 3 sites, the use 
of a Pfannenstiel incision as the extraction site was associated with 
significantly lower odds of developing a hernia compared with the infraumbilical 
midline incision (odds ratio 0.06, 95% CI 0.008 to 0.456).
CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk of hernia in living kidney donors is generally 
low, the use of a Pfannenstiel incision for kidney extraction appears to offer 
an additional incremental reduction in risk.

Recent advances in remote monitoring technologies have empowered continuous 
tracking of physiologic parameters with high accuracy and granularity. However, 
there are important differences in the hardware, data processing, and feedback 
streams of individual devices which can impact the use of digital health 
technologies when evaluating safety in studies. This expert panel is the result 
of a think tank through a public-private partnership of the Cardiovascular 
Sciences Research Consortium and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The 
white paper discusses regulatory considerations for remote monitoring through 
digital health technologies to provide a framework for their use when evaluating 
safety or adverse events. It also provides practical recommendations and best 
practices on the implementation of these technologies into clinical trials 
through a scientific, technical, and operational lens. This manuscript does not 
constitute regulatory guidance.

BACKGROUND: The association between particulate matter (PM) air pollution and 
ventricular arrhythmias is not well established. In patients with cardiac 
implantable electronic devices (CIEDs), publicly available day-level air 
pollution data provide a unique opportunity to study acute and subacute effects 
of PM pollution.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of air 
pollution with ventricular arrhythmias, physical activity, and CIED markers of 
heart failure.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the CERTITUDE database 
(Biotronik SE & Co. KG, Berlin, Germany) of patients with CIEDs. The primary 
predictors were Air Quality Index (AQI), PM < 10 μm in diameter, and PM < 2.5 μm 
in diameter (PM2.5). We cross-linked day-level air pollutant levels with patient 
zip codes. We determined the association of air pollution with CIED parameters 
using (1) a case-crossover analysis using a conditional logistic regression and 
(2) a time-varying exposure analysis with the Andersen-Gill model.
RESULTS: The study cohort included 28,349 patients (9062 [32%] female; mean age 
72.8±11.9 years), of whom 17,448 (61.6%) had pacemakers and 9079 (32%) had 
defibrillators. AQI and PM2.5 were associated with significant changes in 
physical activity, heart rate, and thoracic impedance. When limiting to the 8687 
patients living in Western US Fire States (California, Oregon, Washington, 
Arizona, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, and Colorado), there was a strong association 
between PM2.5 and premature ventricular contraction burden, with an odds ratio 
of 7.72 (95% confidence interval 7.48-7.96; P < .0001) for PM2.5 ≥ 13.7. 
Multiple sensitivity analyses demonstrated the stability of our findings.
CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of patients with CIEDs, AQI and PM2.5 had 
significant associations with premature ventricular contraction burden, physical 
activity, and heart rate. These data also demonstrate the feasibility of linking 
environmental data with patient sensor data to evaluate exposure-outcome 
relationships.

Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) is a life-threatening opportunistic 
infection increasingly recognized among non-HIV immunocompromised patients. In 
severe cases progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome, venovenous 
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) may serve as a rescue therapy. We 
conducted a retrospective multicenter review of 10 adult patients with proven or 
probable PCP who received VV-ECMO between 2017 and 2024. Seven of 10 patients 
survived to discharge, including all three HIV-positive patients and 4 of 7 
non-HIV immunocompromised patients. The mean Respiratory ECMO Survival 
Prediction Score was -1.5, corresponding to a predicted survival of 33-57%. 
Multiorgan dysfunction was common, including renal failure requiring dialysis in 
6 of 10 patients, need for neuromuscular blockade in 8 of 10, and pulmonary 
vasodilator use in 8 of 10. Despite high acuity and prolonged ECMO support, 
outcomes were favorable. These findings suggest that VV-ECMO may be a viable 
salvage therapy for select patients with severe PCP, including those without 
HIV.

PURPOSE: The aim of part one of this EU-US consensus was to combine literature 
research and expertise to provide recommendations for the usage of 
rehabilitation (including physical therapy) of patients undergoing surgical 
treatment for degenerative meniscus lesions or acute meniscus tears (including 
meniscectomy, repair, or reconstruction). Prevention programmes, non-operative 
treatment of acute tears and degenerative lesions, return to sports and 
patient-reported outcome measures will be presented in a part II article.
METHODS: This consensus followed the European Society for Sports Traumatology 
and Arthroscopy (ESSKA)'s 'formal consensus' methodology. For this combined 
ESSKA, American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine and American Academy of 
Sports Physical Therapy initiative, 67 experts (26 in the steering group and 41 
in the rating group) from 14 countries (US and 13 European countries), including 
orthopaedic surgeons, sports medicine doctors and physiotherapists were 
involved. Steering group members established guiding questions, searched the 
literature and proposed statements. Rating group members assessed the statements 
according to a Likert scale and provided grades of recommendations, reaching a 
final agreement about rehabilitation of the knee after meniscus surgery. Final 
documents were then assessed by a peer review group to address the geographical 
adaptability.
RESULTS: The overall level of evidence in the literature was low. Of the 19 
questions (leading to 29 statements), 1 received a Grade A of recommendation, 2 
a Grade B, 9 a Grade C and 17 a Grade D. Nevertheless, the mean median rating of 
all questions was 8.2/9 (9 being the highest rating on a scale of 1-9). The 
global mean rating was 8.4 ± 0.2, indicating a high agreement. Rehabilitation 
depends on the type of lesion, the treatment performed and is the same after 
medial or lateral meniscus surgery. Rehabilitation after meniscectomy should 
follow a criterion-based rehabilitation protocol, based on milestones rather 
than a time-based protocol. After meniscus repair and reconstruction, 
rehabilitation should be progressed according to both time and criterion-based 
milestones.
CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation after meniscus surgery is a debated topic that may 
influence surgical outcomes if not optimally performed. This international 
formal consensus established clear, updated and structured recommendations for 
both surgeons and physiotherapists treating patients after meniscus surgery.

PURPOSE: Part two of this consensus aimed to provide recommendations for the 
prevention of meniscus injuries, non-operative treatment of acute tears and 
degenerative lesions, return to sports and patient-reported outcome measures.
METHODS: This consensus followed the European Society of Knee Surgery, Sports 
Traumatology and Arthroscopy (ESSKA) formal consensus methodology. For this 
combined ESSKA-American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM)-American 
Academy of Sports Physical Therapy (AASPT) initiative, 67 experts from 14 
countries, including orthopedic surgeons and physiotherapists, were involved. 
The 26 Steering Group members established guiding questions, screened the 
existing evidence, and proposed statements, and provided Grades of 
recommendations. The 41 Rating Group members assessed the statements according 
to a Likert scale (1-9). Final documents were assessed by an international peer 
review group for geographical adaptability.
RESULTS: Low to moderate scientific level of evidence was available, so that 
grades of recommendations were low (three Grade A ratings, four Grade B, three 
Grade C and 13 Grade D), underlining the relevance of this consensus. One strong 
and 17 relative agreements with overall median of 8 (8-9) and a mean of 
7.92 ± 0.37 were achieved for 23 statements on 18 questions. Prevention of 
meniscus injuries is possible with general knee injury reduction programmes and 
through avoidance of certain activities. Non-operative treatment including 
physical therapy is the first line approach for degenerative meniscus lesions 
and may be an option for some acute tears. Return to sports after meniscus tear 
surgery should be both criterion-based and time-based. Patient reported outcomes 
in combination with performance-based measures are recommended to evaluate the 
rehabilitation process.
CONCLUSION: This international EU-US consensus established recommendations for 
prevention strategies, describes rehabilitation of non-operated patients and of 
patients after partial meniscectomy, meniscus repair and meniscus 
reconstruction, and establishes return to sport criteria. These updated and 
structured recommendations may be applied by surgeons and physiotherapists.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, consensus.

Recompensation in decompensated cirrhosis.

Recompensation of decompensated cirrhosis has been defined by the Baveno 
consensus as control or cure of the main underlying cause; resolution of 
clinical manifestations, including ascites and hepatic encephalopathy, without 
the use of prophylactic medications, and without variceal bleeding for 12 
months; and restoration of hepatic function. Cure and recompensation are usually 
associated with regression of liver fibrosis. Recompensation can occur when 
hepatitis C virus is eradicated, if hepatitis B virus infection (without 
hepatitis D co-infection) is suppressed, and following persistent alcohol 
abstinence in patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis. Although cirrhosis 
related to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease can improve 
following lifestyle or pharmacotherapy-assisted weight loss, and autoimmune 
liver disease can respond to immunosuppression, it is unclear if true 
recompensation can be achieved in such patients. Recompensation of cirrhosis 
could be an achievable clinical target, offsetting costs of management of 
advanced liver disease, and decreasing the need for liver transplantation. 
Consequently, public health policies should pursue programmes that promote 
alcohol cessation, eliminate viral hepatitis, and address obesity.

BACKGROUND: Intraoperative autologous blood transfusion (IABT) is 
contraindicated during oncologic resection owing to concern for metastasis. 
However, there is a paucity of data to substantiate this claim, and the true 
risk of IABT in patients with cancer remains unknown.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients who underwent oncologic resection 
with IABT during 2010-2021 at our institution. The primary outcome was early 
metastasis. A subgroup analysis of patients who underwent liver transplants for 
malignancy was conducted using inverse probability of treatment weighting to 
compare survival between those who received autologous and allogeneic 
transfusions.
RESULTS: Of 444 patients, the most common diagnoses were hepatocellular 
carcinoma (235, 52.9%), cholangiocarcinoma (68, 15.3%), and renal cell carcinoma 
(18, 4.1%). The median volume of autologous blood transfused was 661 mL 
(interquartile range (IQR) 337-1491 mL). A total of 7 patients (1.6%) 
experienced distant recurrence within 90 days, and 35 (7.9%) within 1 year. Of 
the seven patients with early distant recurrence, only one had metastasis not 
attributable to preoperative factors. In a subgroup analysis of patients 
undergoing liver transplant for malignancy, 299 patients who received IABT were 
compared with 107 patients who received allogeneic transfusion. After adjusting 
for cancer type, age, sex, estimated blood loss, model for end-stage liver 
disease (MELD) score, stage, and allograft type, IABT was not associated with 
overall survival (OS) [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.30 (95% confidence interval 
(CI) 0.82-2.03), p = 0.241] or recurrence-free survival (RFS) [AHR 1.15 (95% CI 
0.77-1.73), p = 0.498].
CONCLUSIONS: IABT does not appear to be associated with early recurrence in 
patients undergoing oncologic resection. IABT should be investigated as a 
possible alternative to massive transfusion of allogeneic blood during oncologic 
resection.

Medicine and Science, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.

Rochester, Minnesota, USA.

BACKGROUND: Urodynamic studies (UDS) are integral to the evaluation and 
management of lower urinary tract dysfunction. However, artifacts are frequently 
encountered, affecting both clinical interpretation and research reliability.
OBJECTIVE: This expert narrative review examines the prevalence, classification, 
and clinical relevance of artifacts encountered during UDS, based on findings 
from the existing literature.
METHODS: A focused literature review was conducted, analyzing studies that 
reported data on the sources and impact of UDS artifacts, particularly from the 
patient perspective. Emphasis was placed on identifying both technical and 
patient-related contributors to artifact generation.
RESULTS: Artifacts are common in UDS despite adherence to Good Urodynamic 
Practices recommended by the International Continence Society. Technical 
artifacts may stem from equipment-related issues such as calibration errors, 
catheter displacement, and device variability. Patient-related artifacts can 
arise from physical movement or test-induced detrusor overactivity. These 
artifacts may lead to misinterpretation, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate 
interventions in clinical practice. Furthermore, they may affect the validity of 
research findings related to diagnostic tools for lower urinary tract symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Identifying and addressing UDS artifacts during the procedure or in 
post-test interpretation is critical for accurate clinical decision-making and 
reliable research outcomes. Efforts to minimize artifacts should be prioritized 
to improve the quality and utility of UDS.

OBJECTIVE: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) is often accompanied by neck 
pain, which, along with more recognized neurological deficits like motor and 
sensory changes, significantly impacts patients' quality of life. The authors 
examined whether age influences improvements in neck disability and related 
quality-of-life measures after surgery for CSM. Using the Neck Disability Index 
(NDI) as the primary outcome, they compared long-term outcomes at 24 months 
among patients aged ≥ 65, ≥75, and < 65 years, exploring the effects of surgical 
intervention on both pain-related disability and functional recovery in older 
adults.
METHODS: Using the Quality Outcomes Database, the authors conducted a detailed 
propensity score-matched analysis on cohorts aged ≥ 65 and ≥ 75 years compared 
with a < 65-year-old cohort while controlling for baseline NDI scores, other 
demographic variables, health status, underlying pathology, number of levels, 
indication for surgery, surgical approach, and type of surgery. Differences in 
NDI total and subdomain scores at 24 months postoperatively were the primary 
measures of improvement. Age-related variability in NDI differential was 
assessed. EQ-5D and calculated SF-6D were secondary measures.
RESULTS: Of the 1141 patients in the cohort (January 2016 to December 2018), 687 
patients were < 65 years, 325 were 65 to < 75 years, and 129 were ≥ 75 years of 
age. After propensity score matching, 197 patients each were well matched in the 
≥ 65-year (mean 71.4 years) and < 65-year (mean 55.3 years) cohorts; similarly, 
57 patients each were matched in the ≥ 75-year (mean 78.3 years) and < 65-year 
(mean 55.8 years) cohorts. Improvements in NDI scores and subdomain scores, 
EQ-5D, and calculated SF-6D were consistent at 3, 12, and 24 months 
postoperatively across all cohorts. At 24 months, patients ≥ 65 years showed NDI 
score improvements (-14.7 ± 22.3) similar to those < 65 years (-13.0 ± 21.3, p = 
0.454), and patients ≥ 75 years demonstrated NDI improvements (-15.0 ± 19.7) 
comparable to those < 65 years (-17.6 ± 20.4, p = 0.499). A sensitivity analysis 
for linear relationship found that NDI improvement was statistically greater in 
older patients (7.5 points every 30 years, p < 0.0001), but this difference was 
below the minimal clinically important difference. Other clinical outcomes were 
similar between cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical intervention for CSM yields substantial and similar 
improvements in NDI scores and other metrics among various age groups, including 
those aged at least 65 and 75 years. These results highlight the effectiveness 
of surgery across a broad patient demographic, underscoring its value in 
treating CSM irrespective of age.

Age considerably influences peripheral nerve regeneration, affecting outcomes 
after surgical repair of nerve injuries, particularly brachial plexus injuries. 
Historically, older patients were considered poor candidates for nerve 
reconstruction because of diminished regenerative capacity and reduced 
functional recovery. However, advances in surgical techniques, especially the 
use of nerve transfers, have led to meaningful functional improvements in 
patients >50 years of age. This review summarizes the current understanding of 
how aging affects nerve regeneration at cellular, molecular, and functional 
levels and provides evidence-based recommendations for managing brachial plexus 
injuries in older adults. Optimal outcomes in older patients are associated with 
early surgical intervention, strategic use of nerve transfers to shorten 
regeneration distances, and realistic patient expectations. Surgeons should 
consider age-related biological constraints while recognizing opportunities for 
considerable functional restoration using modern reconstructive strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether acute myeloperoxidase (MPO) inhibition can 
reduce exertional pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) in patients with 
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), based on the fact that 
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme peroxidase that scavenges nitric oxide and 
contributes to microvascular dysfunction. Patients with heart failure and 
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have microvascular dysfunction that leads to 
increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). We sought to investigate 
whether acute MPO inhibition can reduce exertional PCWP in patients with HFpEF.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1, 2018, and February 24, 2022, participants 
with HFpEF were recruited. They underwent baseline invasive hemodynamic exercise 
evaluation and were then randomized, double-blind, to a single dose of the MPO 
inhibitor mitiperstat at 30 mg or matching placebo, after which they underwent 
repeated invasive hemodynamic exercise testing. The primary end point was PCWP 
during 20-W exercise workload.
RESULTS: Patients with HFpEF (N=30; mean ± SD age, 70±9 years; 11 female [37%]; 
body mass index, 34.0 kg/m2) displayed typical hemodynamic responses to exercise 
prior to treatment, with PCWP increasing from 17±5 to 32±6 mm Hg with exercise 
and mean pulmonary artery pressure increasing from 28±9 to 49±11 mm Hg. Contrary 
to our hypothesis, as compared with placebo, mitiperstat treatment resulted in a 
higher PCWP during the second bout of exercise (-1±3 vs -4±5 mm Hg; P=.04). 
There was a trend for less reduction in mean pulmonary artery pressure and lower 
pulmonary artery compliance during exercise with mitiperstat as compared with 
placebo. There was no effect of mitiperstat on arterial, coronary sinus, or 
transcardiac uptake/release of O2, CO2, and lactate compared with placebo.
CONCLUSION: Acute MPO inhibition with mitiperstat did not reduce exertional 
hemodynamic congestion in patients with HFpEF.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of conization, manipulator use, and their 
interaction on recurrence for patients who underwent radical hysterectomy for 
cervical cancer.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study of 761 patients 
who underwent radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer with minimally invasive 
surgery (MIS; n = 445; laparoscopic or robotic) or open surgery (n = 316) from 
2006 to 2018. All patients had FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and 
Obstetrics) 2009 stage I tumors. Data were abstracted from electronic health 
records. Patients with unclear conization or manipulator data were excluded. 
Patient follow-up data were analyzed for the first 3 years after surgery.
RESULTS: Patients with conization had a reduced risk of recurrence independent 
of surgical approach (MIS: hazard ratio [HR], 0.15; 95 % CI, 0.06-0.34; open: 
HR, 0.31; 95 % CI, 0.12-0.83). For patients in the MIS group with conization, 
manipulator use was not associated with an increased risk of recurrence (HR, 
2.11; 95 % CI, 0.07-64.80). However, for patients in the MIS group without 
conization, manipulator use was associated with a significantly increased risk 
of recurrence (HR, 3.95; 95 % CI, 1.27-12.35). No difference in recurrence was 
observed for patients with conization, regardless of manipulator use or the 
presence of residual tumor in the hysterectomy specimen.
CONCLUSIONS: Conization is an independent factor associated with a decreased 
risk of recurrence, regardless of manipulator use and surgical approach. 
Manipulator use is an independent factor associated with an increased risk of 
recurrence, but only for patients with no conization and tumors 2 cm or larger.

BACKGROUND: In 2020, in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
pandemic, Breast Surgical Oncology (BSO) fellowship programs transitioned to 
virtual interviews; however, for the 2024 cycle, programs selected either 
virtual or in-person interviews with applicants participating in potentially 
both formats. Following the match, a survey was performed to evaluate 
experiences among applicants and program directors (PDs).
METHODS: Surveys were developed within the BSO Fellowship Program Directors 
Committee and distributed via email to matched applicants and PDs from 18 July 
2024 to 9 August 2024. Descriptive statistics were conducted.
RESULTS: Of the 89 matched applicants, 60 completed the survey (response rate 
67.4%). Most applicants (76.7%, n = 46) preferred in-person over virtual 
interviews. The top reason for preferring in-person was 'to see the program in 
person' (56.7%, n = 34). Nearly half of applicants (48.3%, n = 29) estimated 
spending ≥$5000 on interviews, and 78.3% (n = 47) indicated the cost was 'worth 
it'. Over half of applicants (51.7%, n = 31) reported interview style had an 
impact on their match. Of the 64 PDs, 38 completed the survey (response rate 
59.4%). Virtual interviews were the most common format (65.8%, n = 25). The most 
important factor reported by most programs regarding the interview approach was 
cost to applicants (42.1%, n = 16). Over half of PDs (52.6%, n = 20) felt the 
interview approach influenced the match.
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of 2024 BSO fellowship matched applicants preferred 
in-person interviews, noting the importance of location, faculty, and culture to 
their decision making. This data may assist PDs in choosing the interview 
approach best suited for their programs and guide training programs more 
broadly.

Pseudoarthroses (false joints) occur as a complication of fracture healing in 
the normotopic skeleton but have not been reported at ectopic sites. 
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an ultra-rare genetic disorder 
characterized by progressive heterotopic ossification (HO) and congenital 
skeletal abnormalities including developmental arthropathy in the normotopic 
skeleton. Here, we report ectopic pseudojoint formation in 6 patients with FOP, 
all occurring after painful flare-ups and HO in soft connective tissues of the 
knee, hip, and forearm. To our knowledge, FOP is the only human condition in 
which ectopic pseudojoint formation occurs. These findings support that 
dysregulated BMP pathway signaling from mutant ACVR1 mediates not only HO, but 
also ectopic pseudojoint formation, and that ectopic pseudojoints can arise from 
de novo musculoskeletal elements.

INTRODUCTION: Rituximab is used off-label for treating cold agglutinin disease 
(CAD) in the United States; however, real-world data on its use are limited.
METHODS: This study examined (1) treatment patterns, (2) prespecified safety 
outcomes, and (3) changes in hemolytic markers post rituximab infusion 
(threshold change from baseline: hemoglobin [Hb]: ≥2 g/dL increase; bilirubin or 
lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]: ≥50% decrease). Of 611 patients with CAD (Cohort 1) 
identified using Optum's de-identified Market Clarity database (2007-2021), 94 
who received rituximab (Cohort 2) were included.
RESULTS: Rituximab was predominantly used as monotherapy; the median 
(interquartile range; IQR) number of rituximab courses per patient was 1.0 
(1.0-2.0); 24 (25.5%) patients had ≥1 incomplete course and 37 (39.4%) required 
blood transfusion. The incidence rate (IR) of serious infections per 1000 
patient-years (95% CI) post rituximab initiation was three times higher than 
before rituximab initiation (637.1 [242.2-1032.0] vs. 245.4 [125.1-365.6]). 
Cohort 2 had a similar IR of thromboembolic events and slightly higher 
hospitalization rates and deaths than Cohort 1. After the first course of 
rituximab, 69.5% (41/59), 59.6% (28/47), and 31.3% (10/32) of patients reached 
thresholds for Hb, bilirubin, and LDH, respectively. The median (IQR) duration 
of improvement was 44 (13.3-90.8), 98 (29.0-257.0), and 93 (21.3-161.8) days for 
Hb, bilirubin, and LDH, respectively. Reversal from threshold occurred in 68.3% 
(28/41), 53.6% (15/28), and 80.0% (8/10) of patients for Hb, bilirubin, and LDH, 
respectively.
CONCLUSION: Rituximab showed a limited durability of response and an increased 
risk of infection, suggesting the need for more effective and safer treatment 
options.
Trial Registration: The authors have confirmed clinical trial registration is 
not needed for this submission.

BACKGROUND: Patients treated in tertiary cardiac intensive care units (CICUs) 
often arrive via transfer from other hospitals. This "transfer population" is 
poorly described and has been largely excluded from trials in critical care.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize patients who are 
transferred from other hospitals to advanced CICUs.
METHODS: The Critical Care Cardiology Trials Network is an 
investigator-initiated network of predominantly North American CICUs. 
Consecutive CICU admissions during annual 2-month snapshots were submitted to 
the coordinating center (TIMI Study Group) and stratified by transfer vs 
nontransfer status. Adjustment was made for age, sex, study site, and Sequential 
Organ Failure Assessment score.
RESULTS: A total of 21,215 admissions (2017-2023) were included in the analysis. 
Transfers accounted for 38% of admissions and 42% of patient-CICU-days. The 
primary reason for admission was more likely to be acute coronary syndrome (36% 
vs 15% for nontransfers, P < 0.001). Transfers were more likely to have shock 
(35% vs 32%, P = 0.031) and to receive mechanical ventilation (26% vs 17%, P < 
0.001), renal replacement therapy (8% vs 5%, P < 0.001), and invasive monitoring 
(42% vs 34%, P < 0.001). Transfers with shock more frequently received 
mechanical circulatory support (15% vs 8%, P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality was 
higher among transfers, accounting for 44% of all deaths (15% vs 11%, P < 0.001; 
adjusted OR: 1.15 [1.04-1.27]).
CONCLUSIONS: Transfers account for more than 1 of 3 admissions to tertiary 
CICUs, require more complex care, and have higher mortality compared to 
nontransfers. These findings have implications for designing regional systems of 
care, hand-off communication, risk-adjusted reporting, and plans of care for 
this high-risk cohort.

BACKGROUND: As more patients transition from hospital to home for postacute 
care, a growing interest exists in leveraging technology to support recovery, 
yet a limited understanding exists on how to design these tools to align with 
patient and caregiver needs and preferences.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs 
of recently discharged patients to develop user-centered design principles for 
digital tools that support safe and effective transitions from hospital to home.
METHODS: A vignette-based, mixed methods survey was conducted, grounded in the 
technology acceptance model, to explore patient perceptions of digital tools 
supporting postdischarge care. A random sample of 1000 recently discharged adult 
patients received a survey featuring validated vignettes and technology 
acceptance model-informed questions, with both quantitative and qualitative 
items. Open-ended responses were analyzed using grounded theory to derive design 
principles that inform the development and implementation of patient-centered 
digital health tools. Quantitative items were descriptive and are summarized as 
counts (n) and frequencies (%).
RESULTS: Of the 967 eligible patients contacted, 116 completed the survey 
(response rate of 2%), with respondents having a median age of 71 (IQR 61-78) 
years, high rates of chronic illness, and access to smartphones (98/116, 84.5%) 
and in-home internet (111/116, 95.7%). Qualitative analysis revealed 6 key 
themes-connection to care, technical ease of use, solution usability, human 
connection, cost, and privacy-informing 3 patient-centered design principles 
focused on user experience, affordability, and transparent communication to 
guide future technology-supported hospital discharge interventions. Respondents 
reported the following factors as highly important: reassurance that a care team 
member would reach out if something seemed wrong (107/116, 92.2%), 
responsiveness to patient needs (95/116, 81.9%), ability to see their data 
(95/116, 81.9%), and out-of-pocket cost (94/116, 81.0%). Less important factors 
included duration of device use (22/116, 19.0%) and battery life (21/116, 
18.0%).
CONCLUSIONS: Grounded in patient perspectives, this study identified the 3 core 
design principles of user experience and accessibility, cost and privacy, and 
communication and transparency that should guide the development and 
implementation of digital tools to support safe, effective, and human-centered 
transitions from hospital to home.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: An irregular Z-line is characterized by a squamocolumnar 
junction (SCJ) that extends proximally above the gastroesophageal junction by <1 
cm, whereas Barrett's esophagus is defined as a columnar-lined esophagus (CLE) 
that extends proximally by ≥1 cm with the presence of specialized intestinal 
metaplasia on biopsy sampling. Measurement of the CLE is most accurate for 
lengths ≥1 cm, and, as such, guidelines do not recommend biopsy sampling of an 
irregular Z-line when seen on endoscopy. However, a CLE is often estimated by 
visual inspection rather than direct measurement, making this characterization 
imprecise. In this study, we present methodology to standardize the 
characterization of the SCJ, hypothesizing that the shape of the Z-line can be 
used as a surrogate classifier. We present a computer-generated algorithm 
capable of automated segmentation and shape complexity quantification of the 
Z-line.
METHODS: We selected and manually segmented 849 images of the Z-line. We used 
the nnUNet framework (Nature Methods, Heidelberg, Germany) to train a model to 
segment the Z-line. An additional dataset of 58 videos containing the Z-line 
were obtained from the Mayo Clinic Endoscopy video library. A high-quality image 
containing the Z-line was selected from each video. Ten gastroenterologists (5 
esophageal experts) rated each of the 58 video-image pairs containing the Z-line 
as "regular" or "irregular," including their degree of confidence. Fleiss κ 
statistics were used to determine interobserver variability. The "ground truth" 
classification was determined by the esophageal expert majority vote. A wavelet 
decomposition model was then used to determine the threshold of irregularity 
based on the ground truth. Heat maps were generated for each Z-line to determine 
localized areas of complexity.
RESULTS: Fair agreement, with a Fleiss κ of .39, was observed among the 10 
endoscopists when rating the Z-line as regular versus irregular using this 
dataset. Moderate agreement was observed among the 5 esophageal experts with a 
Fleiss κ statistic of .42, and fair agreement was observed among the 5 
nonesophageal experts with a Fleiss κ statistic of .31. The wavelet energy 
coefficient optimal threshold to classify an SCJ as irregular was determined to 
be 1.53 × 107 with an accuracy of 78%.
CONCLUSIONS: Our computer-generated model was capable of automatic segmentation 
and classification of the Z-line. We established a threshold of complexity using 
the wavelet energy coefficient to standardize the classification of the SCJ.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, 
contributing to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The relationship 
between physical exercise and AF is complex, with studies showing both 
beneficial and potentially adverse effects. Moreover, evidence suggests a 
U-shaped association between exercise intensity and AF risk. Moderate exercise 
has been shown to reduce AF burden by improving cardiovascular risk factors, 
enhancing autonomic regulation, and mitigating atrial fibrosis. In contrast, 
excessively high-intensity endurance exercise may increase AF risk, particularly 
in young athletes, due to atrial stretching, dilation, fibrosis, autonomic 
imbalances, and heightened inflammation. The current guidelines emphasize 
exercise as a core lifestyle intervention for AF management, recommending 
moderate-intensity aerobic activity for optimal outcomes. This review examines 
the current evidence on the effects of exercise on AF, identifies knowledge 
gaps, and proposes potential future research directions.

OBJECTIVE: Proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) affects 5%-61% of patients 
following thoracolumbar fusion. Many patients are asymptomatic, but a plurality 
require surgical revision at a cost of $75,000 per case. This analysis sought to 
analyze the degree to which bone quality and paraspinal muscle sarcopenia 
influence PJK failure mode.
METHODS: Patients undergoing thoracolumbar instrumented fusion with an upper 
instrumented vertebra (UIV) at the thoracolumbar junction (T10-L2) were 
identified and data were gathered on surgery, bone quality, pre- and 
postoperative sagittal alignment, and paraspinal muscle cross-sectional area 
(CSA). PJK was defined as a ≥ 10° increase in proximal junctional angle from the 
first postoperative radiograph. PJK was classified as discoligamentous failure 
(type 1), bone failure (type 2), or screw-bone interface failure (type 3) 
according to the Yagi-Boachie system. Bone quality was assessed by Hounsfield 
units (HUs) and the vertebral bone quality (VBQ) score at the UIV.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were identified (median age 67 years, 53.3% 
female), 46 of whom experienced PJK (22 type 1, 13 type 2, 11 type 3). The 
median time to onset was most rapid for type 2 events (2.6 months). There were 
no differences between patients experiencing PJK versus controls regarding bone 
quality (HUs or VBQ score) or paraspinal muscle CSA on univariate comparison. 
However, subdivision by PJK type showed patients experiencing bone failure (type 
2) PJK had significantly lower HUs at the UIV and UIV+1 relative to those 
experiencing type 1 PJK or no PJK (all p < 0.05). The VBQ score trended toward 
being significant, with a higher VBQ score (worse bone quality) in those 
suffering type 2 PJK, but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.07). 
Patients experiencing discoligamentous failure PJK (type 1) had small multifidus 
CSA (390 mm2) relative to patients experiencing type 2 (516 mm2) or type 3 (440 
mm2) PJK and patients who did not experience PJK (481 mm2), although the 
difference did not reach statistical significance. On time-to-event analysis, 
low HUs of the UIV/UIV+1 predicted type 2 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% CI 
0.70-0.93; p = 0.002) and type 2/3 PJK (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.96; p = 0.006) 
but not type 1 PJK. Low UIV multifidus CSA trended toward being a significant 
predictor of type 1 PJK (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69-1.05; p < 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of underlying bone quality and paraspinal 
musculature CSA at the UIV appeared to influence failure mode among patients who 
underwent lumbosacral instrumented fusion terminating at the thoracolumbar 
junction.

BACKGROUND: Emotional Affect reflects an individual's emotional state and can be 
categorized as positive (PA) or negative (NA). We aimed to characterize affect 
in heart transplant candidates and evaluate its relationship with pre- and 
post-transplant psychological and clinical outcomes.
METHODS: Using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), we surveyed 
adult heart transplant candidates across three transplant centers at baseline 
(waitlist enrollment), annually on the waitlist, and post-transplant. We 
assessed PA, NA, and the positivity ratio (PR; PA/NA) as potential predictors of 
waitlist mortality, post-transplant hospital length of stay, readmissions, and 
quality of life.
RESULTS: Among 194 participants, the majority were male (68.6%) and Caucasian 
(84.3%). Baseline PA (36.0 ± 7.8) and NA (17.9 ± 6.4) were comparable to 
population norms and remained stable over time. PR was low at baseline 
(2.3 ± 1.0) and decreased post-transplant (-0.3 ± 1.2; p = 0.03). PA decreased 
and NA increased post-transplant, but neither change was statistically 
significant. Affect was not associated with waitlist mortality, delisting, 
length of stay, or readmissions, but baseline PANAS scores correlated with 
multiple domains of post-transplant quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Heart transplant candidates exhibit a suboptimal PR, which declines 
post-transplant, highlighting significant psychological stress. Pre-transplant 
PANAS scores correlated with post-transplant quality of life, suggesting a 
potential role for psychological screening and intervention in transplant care.

INTRODUCTION: Lung transplant recipients (LTRs) are susceptible to invasive 
candidiasis (IC). This study aimed to assess the incidence, risk factors, and 
impact of IC on mortality in LTRs using a national insurance claims cohort.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative claims 
data from the OptumLabs® Data Warehouse. We identified LTRs from January 1, 
2005, to December 31, 2023, using procedural codes. Exclusion criteria included 
re-transplantations and pre-transplant IC. We employed multivariable logistic 
regression to identify risk factors for IC and Cox Proportional Hazard models to 
assess the impact of IC on mortality.
RESULTS: Among 1279 LTRs, 131 (10.2%) developed IC, primarily during the initial 
hospitalization for lung transplantation (index hospitalization). The median 
time to IC diagnosis was 32.0 days following transplant. Post-transplant 
extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for more than 8 days was associated 
with IC (OR: 2.34; 95% CI 1.03 to 5.34). Mortality was higher in LTRs with IC 
(HR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.45 to 3.67; p < 0.001). LTRs with IC also had longer 
hospital stays (median 26.0 days vs. 20.0 days; p < 0.001) and more 
re-operations (36.7% vs. 27.3%; p = 0.003) compared to those without IC.
CONCLUSION: Invasive candidiasis affects approximately 10% of lung transplant 
recipients, most often during the initial hospitalization. It is associated with 
increased mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and a greater need for surgical 
re-intervention. These findings highlight the importance of early identification 
and targeted preventive strategies to improve outcomes in this high-risk 
population.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Patient- and family-centered rounds (PFCR) have become a 
pediatric standard of care. However, rounds experiences of families using 
languages other than English (LOE)-particularly languages other than English or 
Spanish (LOES; eg, Arabic)-receive less focus. We aimed to identify differences 
in PFCR communication and engagement by language.
METHODS: We analyzed postintervention data from a 21-center structured PFCR 
study, assessing communication practices, quality, and family and nurse 
engagement during PFCR. Logistic regression adjusted by site compared PFCR 
between families using (1) LOE vs English, (2) Spanish vs English, and (3) LOES 
vs English.
RESULTS: Among 3051 PFCR encounters, 348 (11.4%) involved LOE (Spanish = 260; 
LOES = 85). Interpretation was not used in 7.2%, 5.8%, and 9.4% of encounters 
using LOE, Spanish, and LOES, respectively. PFCR in the following groups had 
lower adjusted odds (adjusted odds ratio [95% CI]) for the following domains: 
(1) LOE vs English: including providing verbal patient summaries (0.66 
[0.46-0.95]), explaining diagnoses and differentials (0.62 [0.44-0.88]), family 
engagement (0.34 [0.20-0.57]), nursing inclusion (0.75 [0.60-0.93]), and nursing 
engagement (0.69 [0.52-0.90]). (2) Spanish vs English: diagnoses/differentials 
being explained (0.56 [0.37-0.85]), family engagement (0.35 [0.18-0.67]), 
nursing inclusion (0.77 [0.59-1.00]), and nursing engagement (0.68 [0.52-0.89]). 
(3) LOES vs English: families sharing concerns (0.66 [0.47-0.93]), family 
engagement (0.30 [0.16-0.54]), and nursing inclusion (0.74 [0.55-0.99]).
CONCLUSION: Even after implementing a PFCR intervention, families using 
LOE-especially LOES-experienced significant disparities in communication and 
engagement. Future approaches to improving PFCR should emphasize language access 
and promote nurse and family engagement for families using LOE, particularly 
LOES.

Regulatory agencies are advancing the use of systematic approaches to collect 
patient experience data, including patient-reported outcomes (PROs), in cancer 
clinical trials to inform regulatory decision-making. Due in part to clinician 
under-reporting of symptomatic adverse events, there is a growing recognition 
that evaluation of cancer treatment tolerability should include the patient 
experience, both in terms of the overall side effect impact and symptomatic 
adverse events. Methodologies around implementation, analysis, and 
interpretation of "patient" reported tolerability are under development, and 
current approaches are largely descriptive. There is robust guidance for use of 
PROs as efficacy endpoints to compare cancer treatments, but it is unclear to 
what extent this can be relied-upon to develop tolerability endpoints. An 
important consideration when developing endpoints to compare tolerability 
between treatments is the linkage of trial design, objectives, and statistical 
analysis. Despite interest in and frequent collection of PRO data in oncology 
trials, heterogeneity in analyses and unclear PRO objectives mean that design, 
objectives, and analysis may not be aligned, posing substantial challenges for 
the interpretation of results. The recent ICH E9 (R1) estimand framework 
represents an opportunity to help address these challenges. Efforts to apply the 
estimand framework in the context of PROs have primarily focused on efficacy 
outcomes. In this paper, we discuss considerations for comparing the 
patient-reported tolerability of different treatments in an oncology trial 
context.

Exercise benefits both physical and mental health. However, women veterans (WVs) 
face unique barriers to exercise which may be mitigated by trauma-informed 
practices such as incorporating lived experience into program development. This 
study engaged WVs to identify their exercise preferences and perceptions, aiming 
to inform future development of trauma-informed exercise interventions. WVs 
enrolled in a longitudinal cohort study were invited to participate in this 
mixed-methods pilot study, which included a survey and qualitative interview to 
explore exercise preferences, barriers, and facilitators. Twelve WVs (mean 
age = 47.7 years; 58.3 % white; 58.3 % lifetime PTSD; 33.3 % lifetime TBI) 
completed the survey and interview. All WVs were interested in an exercise 
program tailored to their needs. Exercise preferences were mixed, with 
preferences for home-based (n = 8, 67 %), group supervision (n = 7, 58 %), 
moderate-intensity (n = 9, 75 %) programs that take place with other WVs. 
Endorsed exercise types included walking (n = 10, 83 %), weight training (n = 9, 
75 %), and yoga (n = 9, 75 %). Strongest barriers to exercise were low 
motivation (n = 7, 58 %) and time constraints (n = 5, 42 %), and strongest 
motivators were promoting mental health (n = 10, 83 %), preventing disease 
(n = 9, 75 %), and improving or maintaining physical fitness (n = 9, 75 %). 
Interviews highlighted the prevalence of sexual and partner violence throughout 
WVs lives and their impact on exercise engagement. Thematic analyses identified 
barriers (feeling unsafe in gyms, poor mental health, lack of tailored programs, 
and pain) and facilitators (promoting physical and mental health, structure and 
accountability, social connection with other WVs). Findings indicate that WVs 
are interested in exercise programs tailored to their needs. These results are 
being used to guide the local development of trauma-informed exercise programs 
for WVs and highlight directions for future research.

OBJECTIVES: Sarcomas are rare, mesenchymal tumors that require multimodality 
treatment provided by multidisciplinary teams. This study seeks to better 
understand sarcoma patient narratives and quality of life in relation to the 
social determinants of health (SDoH).
METHODS: Eligible patients who were diagnosed with sarcoma, treated by our 
institution's orthopedic oncology team, and identified with at least one social 
risk factor were contacted about participating in a semi-structured interview. 
SDoH information collected included (1) Economic Stability, (2) Access to Health 
Care, (3) Neighborhood & Physical Environment, (4) Social & Community Context, 
and (5) Education Access and Quality. Interviews were then recorded, 
de-identified, transcribed, and coded by reviewers. The validated Framework 
Method for qualitative research was used to summarize themes. Descriptive 
statistics were used to summarize the percentage of participants that identified 
with each SDoH concern.
RESULTS: 100% of patients (N = 17) discussed how quality and access to 
healthcare affected their experience. 88.2% of participants expressed the 
importance of transportation. 29.4% of participants discussed how they thought 
their educational background affected their cancer care. Other common themes 
centered around social support, employment, financial security, and insurance.
CONCLUSION: Our research elicited ways in which SDoH affected the care 
experience of patients with sarcoma. The identified domains offer clinicians 
valuable information into non-clinical factors, such as employment concerns or 
transportation issues, that may affect care for patients with sarcoma. 
Interdisciplinary care providers (social workers, psychologists, financial 
navigators) may also help promote open dialogues with patients about their 
social circumstances and actively facilitate connections to institutional 
resources or community support systems.

McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is defined by a triad of fibrous dysplasia (FD), 
hyperfunctioning endocrinopathies, and café-au-lait spots. FD, characterized by 
the fibrous replacement of healthy bone, is a major source of morbidity in MAS. 
To characterize skeletal involvement and associated endocrinopathies in patients 
with MAS/FD, we conducted a retrospective review of patients with the diagnosis 
of both MAS and FD treated at our center between 1989 and 2024. Forty-three 
patients (29 female; median diagnosis age: 13.1 years) were included, with 41 
presenting with polyostotic FD. Among these, 19 had both craniofacial and 
extracraniofacial involvement, 4 had craniofacial-only, and 18 had 
extracraniofacial-only disease. The lower extremities were most commonly 
affected (n=32), followed by the skull (n=25). All patients with lower extremity 
FD had femoral involvement; 10 had bilateral disease. Chronic pain was reported 
by 23 patients. Among those with lower extremity FD, 16 had deformities-most 
commonly leg length discrepancies (n=10) and shepherd's crook deformities (n=6). 
Femoral fractures occurred in 21 patients, with higher risk in those with 
deformities (p=0.006). Precocious puberty occurred at a median age of 4.8 years. 
Hyperfunctioning endocrinopathies were observed in 17 patients: cortisol excess 
(n=2), hyperthyroidism (n=8), elevated GH/IGF-1 (n=10), and phosphate wasting 
(n=6). Hormone levels, age at puberty, and age at diagnosis were not associated 
with fracture or deformity risk (p>0.05). One patient developed osteosarcoma 
requiring above-knee amputation. In conclusion, extracraniofacial skeletal 
disease and endocrinopathies are common in MAS. Coordinated interdisciplinary 
care is vital to manage deformities and systemic complications.

PURPOSE: To identify areas of consensus among global experts for the management 
of Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) in clinical practice, including 
its diagnosis, evaluation, decision-making principles with respect to 
intervention, and recommendations for performing cataract surgery in patients 
with FECD, including when to combine with keratoplasty.
DESIGN: Modified Delphi-based global consensus.
PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-seven ophthalmologists from around the world with 
significant expertise in the management and mechanisms of FECD.
METHODS: A series of consensus statements about FECD were developed from three 
iterative rounds of structured questions and statements posed to the panel of 
experts. Two rounds were asynchronous electronic questionnaires, and the third 
round was a live virtual meeting. Experts responded anonymously to statements 
assessing consensus and to open-ended questions that invited diverse input.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Consensus was defined as ³70% agreement among experts.
RESULTS: Consensus was reached for 90 of 91 statements after three rounds. 
Experts agreed that FECD is defined by the presence of central or paracentral 
scattered or confluent guttae with or without edema. There was strong consensus 
that a chronic state of subclinical edema precedes the onset of clinically 
detectable edema that may or may not cause symptoms. With near-unanimous 
consensus, disease evaluation recommendations included assessing for findings 
that implicate the cornea as a source of decreased vision to separate it from 
the effect of comorbid conditions, as this would inform whether corneal 
intervention is appropriate. These findings include diurnal variation in vision, 
clinical or subclinical (tomographic) edema, and changes or differences in 
central corneal thickness. Based on current evidence, experts agreed that there 
are no effective medical therapies for FECD, and that Descemet membrane 
endothelial keratoplasty is the surgical treatment of choice when indicated.
CONCLUSIONS: The consensus statements provide current globally endorsed 
recommendations for the diagnosis and management of FECD. The guidelines are 
important and relevant for general ophthalmologists, who typically first 
diagnose and evaluate FECD, and for cornea specialists, by allowing them to 
benchmark their current practice patterns against expert recommendations. This 
could help improve patient outcomes and establish a framework adaptable to 
future advances and evolving technologies in the management of FECD.

thrombosis.

Ischemic monomelic neuropathy (IMN) is a rare peripheral neuropathy caused by 
limb ischemia and subsequent nerve degeneration, typically manifesting with 
unilateral pain, paresthesia, and numbness without overt signs of limb ischemia. 
This case report describes a 59-year-old female with extensive peripheral artery 
disease who developed IMN in her right lower extremity following an acute, 
intraoperative in-sheath thrombosis during a right femoral endarterectomy and 
external iliac artery stent placement, a rare etiology distinct from the more 
commonly reported associations with bypass surgery or hemodialysis access. 
Despite successful intraoperative revascularization, the patient developed 
diminished motor and sensory function with unremitting pain, and subsequent 
electromyography confirmed a length-dependent neuropathy with features of 
denervation, consistent with IMN. This case underscores the critical need for 
clinicians to consider IMN in the differential diagnosis of post-procedural 
neuropathic pain, even in the absence of classic ischemic signs and following 
seemingly successful vascular interventions, as acute thrombotic events during 
vascular procedures can precipitate this debilitating condition.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is an important risk factor associated with atrial 
fibrillation (AF). The impact of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists 
(GLP-1 RAs) on recurrent AF among patients undergoing catheter ablation is not 
well described.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of GLP-1 RA on the recurrence 
of AF among obese patients after catheter ablation.
METHODS: Utilizing the TriNetX research network, we identified patients aged 
over 18 with obesity (BMI ≥ 30) who underwent AF ablation from January 1, 2015, 
to December 1, 2022, using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Patients were 
categorized based on their baseline GLP-1 RA use. Through propensity-score 
matching, each cohort comprised 1558 patients. The primary outcome encompassed a 
composite of cardioversion, initiation of new antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy, 
or redo AF ablation. Additional outcomes during the 12-month follow-up included 
AF readmission, heart failure readmissions, readmissions due to ischemic stroke, 
and mortality, with a separate analysis done for patients with BMI > 40.
RESULTS: GLP-1 RA use in patients with obesity undergoing AF ablation was linked 
to a significantly reduced risk of cardioversion, new AAD therapy, and the need 
for redo AF ablation (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72 [0.65-0.80]; p < 0.001). At 12 
months, individuals on GLP-1 agonists exhibited a lower likelihood of mortality 
(HR 0.61 [0.40-0.93]; p < 0.001). Although all other secondary outcomes were 
lower in the GLP-1 RA group, there was no significant difference in ischemic 
stroke between the groups. These results were consistent among patients with 
BMI > 40, although apart from ischemic stroke, there was no difference in 
mortality between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: The utilization of GLP-1 RA in individuals with obesity is linked to 
a decreased likelihood of arrhythmia recurrence following AF ablation, leading 
to a reduced requirement for cardioversion, AAD therapy, or redo AF ablation.

Bladder cancer diagnosis is challenged by invasive monitoring and workflow 
inefficiencies impacting diagnostic reliability. This prospective study enrolled 
150 patients (January 2020-December 2022) and evaluated a novel liquid-based 
immunocytochemistry platform, coupled with integrated machine learning, for 
detecting urothelial carcinoma in voided urine. All 150 cytology slides met the 
adequacy threshold of ≥2,644 urothelial cells and showed preserved 
cytomorphology. Eight cases of papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant 
potential (PUNLMP) were set aside a-priori, yielding an analytic cohort of 142 
patients (115 urothelial-carcinoma, 27 benign) for performance analysis. hTERT 
(sensitivity 92.2%, specificity 66.7%), GATA-3 (67.0%, 88.9%), and CK17 (89.6%, 
66.7%). In multi-marker analysis, sensitivity reached 100% (95% CI 96.8-100) 
when any marker was positive, whereas specificity reached 100% (95% CI 87.3-100) 
when all three markers were positive. The workflow-optimized platform 
standardizes specimen preparation and multi-marker interpretation, offering a 
robust foundation for urine-based bladder-cancer diagnostics. Larger, 
multi-center validation studies are warranted to refine specificity estimates 
and facilitate laboratory integration. This study demonstrates that addressing 
fundamental workflow challenges in bladder cancer diagnostics before 
implementing artificial intelligence creates more effective diagnostic tools. By 
prioritizing specimen integrity and standardization through a novel liquid 
immunocytochemistry platform, exceptional diagnostic performance was achieved 
with 100% sensitivity and specificity under defined marker parameters across 
various cancer stages. This workflow-first approach to integrating machine 
learning with advanced biomarker analysis offers a model for developing 
clinically practical diagnostic innovations that can reduce reliance on invasive 
monitoring procedures while improving detection accuracy.

INTRODUCTION: Optimizing cognitive outcomes of pediatric epilepsy surgery 
requires understanding of risk for change in function, typically based on 
hemispheric lateralization of language skills. Identification of cognitive 
lateralization in children is complicated by disease in the setting of ongoing 
functional development. A quantitative method for assessing lateralization, the 
Cognitive Lateralization Rating Index (CLRI), was used as a systematic way to 
assess lateralized cognitive dysfunction in a sample of pediatric epilepsy 
surgery candidates.
METHOD: The current study examined demographic and clinical variables in 
relation to the CLRI in 179 patients evaluated prior to epilepsy surgery from a 
national multi-site cohort.
RESULTS: The sample was comprised of 179 patients (43.3% female; 76.3% White, 
83.6% not Hispanic/Latino; age of seizure onset M 6.58 years; seizure type: 
84.7% focal; side of seizure onset: 51.3% left hemisphere, 38.1% right 
hemisphere). Results demonstrated that lateralization of cognitive dysfunction 
in a pediatric sample, as well as characterization of presumed atypical 
functional organization, is possible with the CLRI. There was no significant 
association of demographic variables on lateralization. Age of seizure onset was 
not significantly related to the CLRI. Children with focal epilepsy were more 
likely to have lateralized cognitive profiles than children with generalized 
seizures, though this relationship was not significant. Additionally, analyses 
demonstrated those with left hemisphere seizures were significantly more likely 
to have dominant hemisphere dysfunction or presumed atypical organization on the 
CLRI.
CONCLUSIONS: Results establish the CLRI as a potentially useful tool for both 
research and clinical care to quantitively stratify cognitive risk profiles for 
pediatric epilepsy surgery evaluations.

The Dublin ISUP Consensus Conference covered the proceedings on the best 
practice recommendations on nonurachal glandular lesions of the urinary bladder, 
bladder diverticular cancers, and molecular features of bladder and urachal 
glandular lesions. The conference proceedings on urachal neoplasms (except for 
their molecular features) are published elsewhere. The rationale for convening 
this conference was the lack of structured and consented pathologic 
recommendations in these rare lesions. Consensus by participants was reached on 
the following statements: (1) intestinal metaplasia with dysplasia is considered 
to be a precursor to primary bladder adenocarcinoma; (2) dysplasia arising from 
cystitis glandularis should be reported in terms of focality (focal or nonfocal) 
and grade (low or high); (3) the term "adenocarcinoma" should only be used for 
carcinomas showing pure (nonurothelial) morphology and should not be used 
interchangeably in urothelial carcinoma with "glandular differentiation" because 
of the pathobiological differences and management implications; (4) the 
different histologic subtypes of bladder adenocarcinoma should be specified in 
the report; (5) immunohistochemistry has an ancillary role in the work up of 
bladder adenocarcinoma versus gastrointestinal or Müllerian-type 
adenocarcinomas; (6) lymphovascular invasion should be included as a parameter 
when reporting bladder adenocarcinoma; (7) representative or targeted sampling 
will be sufficient for bladder diverticulum resection specimens; and (8) 
molecular analysis in genomic profiling should be performed only in advanced or 
metastatic bladder and urachal adenocarcinomas for targetable therapy. This 
report on glandular (nonurachal) lesions of the bladder from the Dublin ISUP 
consensus conference will serve as a best practice recommendation and as a guide 
for future research on these relatively rare lesions.

OBJECTIVES: There is a limited number of studies comparing paediatric to adult 
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) patients. Our objective was to analyse the 
characteristics of patients presenting with antiphospholipid antibody 
(aPL)-related clinical manifestations during childhood versus adulthood.
METHODS: We retrieved baseline characteristics from an international registry of 
persistently aPL-positive adult patients. Clinical events were grouped as 
vascular and non-vascular. We compared the frequency of and the timeline between 
vascular and non-vascular events for different age groups at the time of their 
first aPL-related manifestations: a) paediatric- (0-17 years) versus adult-onset 
(18-75 years); and b) based on narrower age intervals. Secondly, we analysed the 
timeline between the first aPL-related clinical event and first aPL positivity.
RESULTS: Of 787 patients, 447 (57%) had only vascular events, 108 (14%) only 
non-vascular events, and 232 (29%) both. Compared to adult-onset patients 
(n=742), paediatric-onset patients (n=45) presented more commonly with a 
non-vascular event (49% vs. 19%, p=0.0001). The percentage of patients 
presenting with a non-vascular event mostly decreased with each increasing age 
group. Timeline analysis demonstrated 317 (40%) patients had a positive aPL test 
within the same calendar year (c-y) of the first clinical event, 207 (26%) 
within 1 to 3 c-y, and 263 (33%) more than 3 c-y.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis of an international registry for persistently 
aPL-positive patients demonstrates that patients with paediatric-onset 
aPL-related manifestations more commonly present with non-vascular events. These 
results highlight the importance of understanding the clinical differences 
between paediatric and adult APS patients, which have diagnostic, therapeutic, 
and research implications.

This technical standard was developed as a guide for laboratories performing 
prenatal screening for Down syndrome. It addresses 3 topics: second trimester 
(triple or quad), first trimester, including incorporation of nuchal 
translucency, and current directions in cell-free DNA screening. Analytic 
methods, clinical considerations, screening performance, guidelines for 
reporting second trimester, first trimester, integrated, contingent, and reflex 
screening tests for Down syndrome, are discussed. Individual laboratories are 
responsible for meeting the quality assurance standards described by the 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, the College of American 
Pathologists, and other regulatory agencies, with respect to appropriate sample 
documentation, assay validation, general proficiency, and quality control 
measures.

In August 2023, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 
introduced an updated staging system for endometrial cancer that integrates 
histopathologic and molecular characteristics (optional) of the tumor alongside 
with anatomic extent of the disease. This innovative approach aims to improve 
the prognostication of the system and the identification of treatment-relevant 
patient populations by more accurately stratifying patients based on tumor 
biology, representing a significant advancement toward personalized medicine. 
However, its implementation poses challenges, including the heterogeneous 
availability of molecular testing worldwide, and the need for further 
standardization and prospective validation of some of the newly introduced 
histopathological parameters. To address these innovations and related 
controversies, a meeting of physicians, including gynecologic oncologists and 
pathologists, was held. This article summarizes the reflections that emerged 
from this meeting, focusing on key elements such as the integration of 
histopathologic features (eg, "high-grade, aggressive histologic types," 
"substantial lymphovascular space invasion"), molecular classification, and the 
implications for global reproducibility and applicability. It also addresses the 
basic approach toward staging: should it offer integrated, patient-relevant 
information to enable accurate prognostication and inform treatment decisions or 
should a staging system simply provide a common language to communicate disease 
extent? The meeting provided an opportunity for a group of physicians to share 
considerations on this evolving topic. Our article highlights focal points of 
change in the new staging system and identifies key areas for future research, 
advocating for collaborative efforts to generate more robust evidence on some 
variables introduced in the staging system through prospective studies. By 
addressing these challenges, we aim to improve the applicability and 
effectiveness of the new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics 
staging system in real-world scenarios and identify elements that may require 
further refinement, ultimately advancing precision medicine in endometrial 
cancer care.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is the mainstay treatment for rhythm 
control in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (PsAF). However, due to 
the complex mechanisms of PsAF, the efficacy of PVI alone remains modest. 
Spatiotemporal electrogram dispersion (STED) ablation is a promising strategy to 
enhance outcomes. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of STED ablation plus 
PVI versus PVI alone in PsAF ablation.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify studies published up to 
November 2024 comparing PVI plus STED ablation (PVI-STED group) versus PVI alone 
(PVI group) in patients with PsAF. The primary outcomes were AF recurrence and 
sinus rhythm (SR) conversion.
RESULTS: Eleven studies (three randomized controlled trials, three prospective 
cohorts, five retrospective cohorts) involving 1607 patients (mean age of 
63.9 ± 9.3 years) were included. The PVI-STED group was significantly associated 
with a lower risk of AF recurrence (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.27-0.59, I² = 25%) and a 
higher likelihood of SR conversion (OR: 7.04, 95% CI: 1.62-30.62, I2 = 79%). No 
significant differences were observed in procedural time (MD: 27.61 min, 95% CI: 
-29.12 to 84.33, I² = 97%), ablation time (MD: 4.4 min, 95% CI: -11.3 to 20.0, 
I2 = 98%), or fluoroscopy time (0.25 min, 95% CI: -3.4 to 3.9, I2 = 95%). The 
overall rate of AEs in the PVI-STED group was 1% (95% CI: 1%-3%, I2 = 0%).
CONCLUSION: The PVI-STED approach demonstrated both efficacy and safety in 
treating PsAF, as evidenced by reduced AF recurrence and improved SR conversion 
rates.

response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and 
transcriptomic spatial profiling. QuantCRC was evaluated in an observational 
cohort of 288 pretherapy biopsies and a separate validation cohort of 37 
pretherapy biopsies of rectal adenocarcinoma from patients undergoing 
neoadjuvant therapy. Associations between QuantCRC features and clinical 
outcomes, pCR, and RFS were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression and 
Cox proportional hazards modeling, respectively. QuantCRC variables were also 
correlated with transcriptomic digital spatial profiling of 37 pretreatment 
biopsies of cT3N+ rectal cancer. QuantCRC-derived lymphocytes per square 
millimeter of tumor epithelium (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TILs]) was 
significantly associated with pCR (multivariate odds ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 
1.02-1.10; P = .038). QuantCRC-derived TILs were significantly higher in 
pretherapy biopsies with pCR (91.3 vs 55.9 lymphocytes/mm2; P = .004). The 
validation cohort confirmed that only QuantCRC-derived TILs in pretherapy 
biopsies of rectal cancer were significantly associated with complete response 
to neoadjuvant therapy. QuantCRC %high tumor grade was independently associated 
with worse RFS (multivariate hazards ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.09-1.47; P = .002). 
Patients with ≥10.1% high tumor grade identified by QuantCRC had significantly 
reduced RFS (5-year RFS 69% vs 83%, log-rank P = .007). Transcriptomic profiling 
identified high interleukin (IL)-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling within immune cells to be 
associated with worse RFS (adjusted P = .01). Tumors with low IL-6/JAK/STAT3 
expression within immune cells had significantly higher TILs compared with 
tumors with high expression (median, 152 vs 97 TILs/mm2; P = .039). 
Biopsy-adapted QuantCRC in pretherapy rectal cancer may be helpful in 
identifying patients who achieve pCR and are at risk for recurrence.

PURPOSE: Harlequin syndrome is a rare autonomic disorder characterized by 
unilateral facial flushing and contralateral anhidrosis. We sought to delineate 
underlying causes, clinical presentations, and autonomic testing profiles of 
patients with Harlequin syndrome.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed of the Mayo Clinic electronic 
health record for patients with a Harlequin syndrome diagnosis from 1998 to 
2024. Clinical, laboratory, imaging, and autonomic function testing results, 
including autonomic reflex screen (ARS) and thermoregulatory sweat test (TST), 
were reviewed.
RESULTS: Of 51 patients with Harlequin syndrome, 39 (76%) were women. Median age 
of onset was 52 years (range 8-73 years). Harlequin syndrome was often 
idiopathic (N = 19; 37%), followed by postsurgical (N = 9; 17%), neoplasm 
(N = 5; 9.8%), trauma (N = 4; 7.8%), small fiber neuropathy (N = 4; 7.8%), 
systemic causes (N = 3; 5.9%), autoimmune (N = 3; 5.9%), pure autonomic failure 
(N = 2; 3.9%), and multiple sclerosis (N = 1; 2%). Pupil abnormalities were 
found in 13 patients (25.5%) with abnormal muscle stretch reflexes in 17 
(33.3%). Headache was a comorbidity in 20 patients (39%). Of those with 
postsurgical onset, various surgeries preceded Harlequin syndrome onset, 
including heart, lung, and neck operations. Onset was acute or subacute in the 
majority of postsurgical patients (57%), while insidious onset was most common 
in nonsurgical patients (89%; p = 0.001). Median anhidrosis on TST was 9% (range 
0.6-63%; N = 27). Median composite autonomic severity score was 1 (interquartile 
range (IQR) 0-3; N = 31).
CONCLUSIONS: Harlequin syndrome commonly has an insidious onset and occurs 
without an identifiable cause, which could be considered primary Harlequin 
syndrome. Secondary Harlequin syndrome can occur following surgeries in the 
vicinity of sympathetic pathways, which most commonly leads to an acute or 
subacute presentation.

We describe an unpredictable clinical scenario involving an intraoperative 
vascular injury during an elective total shoulder arthroplasty. Shortly into the 
procedure, the patient became acutely hypotensive due to frank hemorrhage. The 
patient experienced a complete transection of the third segment of the axillary 
artery caused by an unrecognized bone fragment, suspected to have dislodged into 
the joint space following a traumatic ground-level fall 12 months prior. 
Emergency vascular surgical intervention was required for hemostasis.

BACKGROUND: A two-stage exchange arthroplasty is the standard management method 
of chronic periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) of the hip in North America. 
However, a subset of patients become reinfected and may require a repeat 
two-stage exchange arthroplasty. The purpose of the present study was to assess 
revisions, reoperations, and risk factors for failure associated with repeat 
two-stage exchange arthroplasties for recurrent PJIs after total hip 
arthroplasty (THA).
METHODS: We identified 52 repeat two-stage exchange THAs completed from 2000 to 
2021 at a single, high-volume academic medical center. The mean age was 61 
years, 39% were women, and the mean body mass index was 33. At the time of the 
repeat two-stage exchange, high-dose antibiotic spacers were used in 90% of 
patients (28 articulating, 19 nonarticulating), and 10% had a resection 
arthroplasty in the interim between stages. The mean time from repeat first 
stage to reimplantation was 33 weeks. At the final follow-up, 54% of patients 
were on chronic antibiotic therapy. The mean follow-up was 6 years.
RESULTS: The 7-year survivorships free of re-revision for reinfection, any 
re-revision, and any reoperation were 85, 57, and 50%, respectively. The leading 
indications for re-revision were dislocation (45%) and PJI (35%). McPherson host 
grade C was a significant risk factor for re-revision for infection (HR [hazard 
ratio] 5, P = 0.04). Additionally, increased operative time at reimplantation 
was a risk for any reoperation (HR 1.06, P < 0.01) and reoperation for infection 
(HR 1.07, P < 0.01). At the final follow-up, 98% of patients had a revision THA 
in situ (one hip disarticulation).
CONCLUSIONS: Repeat two-stage exchange arthroplasty of the hip had a 7-year 
survivorship free of re-revision for infection that was 85%, but only 57% were 
free of any re-revision (most due to revision for dislocation). McPherson C 
hosts had a 5-fold increased risk of reinfection.

Tau positron emission tomography (PET) imaging allows in vivo detection of tau 
proteinopathy in Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with neurodegeneration 
and cognitive decline. Understanding how demographic, clinical and genetic 
factors relate to tau PET positivity will facilitate its use for clinical 
practice and research. Here we conducted an analysis of 42 cohorts worldwide 
(N = 12,048), including 7,394 cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants, 2,177 
participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 2,477 participants with 
dementia. We found that from age 60 years to 80 years, tau PET positivity in a 
temporal composite region increased from 1.1% to 4.4% among CU amyloid-β 
(Aβ)-negative participants and from 17.4% to 22.2% among CU Aβ-positive 
participants. Across the same age span, tau PET positivity decreased from 68.0% 
to 52.9% in participants with MCI and from 91.5% to 74.6% in participants with 
dementia. Age, Aβ status, APOE ε4 carriership and female sex were all associated 
with a higher prevalence of tau PET positivity across groups. APOE ε4 
carriership in CU individuals lowered the age at onset of both Aβ positivity and 
tau positivity by decades. Finally, we replicated these associations in an 
independent autopsy dataset (N = 5,072 from 3 cohorts).

BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is a state of increased metabolic demand that necessitates 
major changes in endocrine physiology. Gestational thyroid dysfunction and 
gestational diabetes are common endocrine conditions of pregnancy that 
frequently coincide. Although the effects of thyroid hormones on glucose 
metabolism are well documented, important knowledge gaps remain in terms of the 
extent and clinical relevance of these effects during pregnancy. The aim of this 
meta-analysis is to assess the association of thyroid function test results with 
gestational diabetes and markers of glucose metabolism.
METHODS: In this systematic review and individual participant data 
meta-analysis, we searched Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science from 
database inception to Dec 12, 2024, for prospective population-based cohort 
studies with individual patient data on thyroid function, gestational diabetes, 
and measures of glucose homoeostasis during pregnancy. Furthermore, open 
invitations to join the Consortium on Thyroid and Pregnancy were issued to 
identify unpublished datasets. We excluded participants with multiple 
pregnancies; pre-existing thyroid disease or diabetes; current use of 
medications that could affect thyroid or glucose levels; or a history of 
infertility treatment, miscarriage, or stillbirth. Exposures were maternal 
gestational concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4 (FT4), 
free T3 (FT3), and total T3; thyroperoxidase antibody positivity; thyroglobulin 
antibody positivity; and thyroid disease entities (ie, subclinical 
hypothyroidism, overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism, and isolated 
hypothyroxinaemia), which were defined according to current guidelines. The 
primary outcome was presence of gestational diabetes as defined in individual 
cohorts. Individual participant data were analysed using generalised linear 
mixed-effects regression models adjusting for maternal age, BMI, smoking status, 
parity, ethnicity, fetal sex, and gestational age at blood sampling. We 
preregistered our study protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42022371927).
FINDINGS: We identified 638 published studies with our systematic search, of 
which 21 studies based on 17 cohorts met inclusion criteria; 11 of these 
prospective cohort studies provided individual participant data, and data from 
an additional 14 cohorts were added via personal contacts and open invitations, 
resulting in a study population of 63 548 participants from 25 cohorts after 
exclusions. Of the 52 632 participants in 17 cohorts with TPOAb measurements 
available to define thyroid disease entities, 1687 (3·2%) of these participants 
had subclinical hypothyroidism, 1153 (2·2%) had isolated hypothyroxinaemia, and 
2958 (4·7%) had gestational diabetes. Compared with euthyroidism, isolated 
hypothyroxinaemia was associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes 
(absolute risk 6·5% [72 of 1113] for isolated hypothyroxinaemia vs 3·5% [1555 of 
44 787] for euthyroidism; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1·52 [95% CI 1·17-1·98], 
p=0·0017; 45 900 participants). A lower FT4 concentration was associated with a 
higher risk of gestational diabetes (non-linear, p<0·0001). A higher risk of 
gestational diabetes was found both with a higher FT3 concentration (aOR 1·18 
[95%CI 1·10-1·28], p<0·0001) and with a higher FT3-to-FT4 ratio (non-linear; 
p<0·0001). No evidence was found of associations of TSH, thyroid antibodies, or 
other thyroid function test abnormalities with gestational diabetes. I2 
statistics for the primary analyses ranged from 0-43%, indicating low to 
moderate heterogeneity. The funnel plot for overt hyperthyroidism indicated a 
possibility for publication bias (p=0·049), but funnel plots for all other 
variables did not.
INTERPRETATION: A lower FT4 concentration and isolated hypothyroxinaemia during 
pregnancy are associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes. Our results 
challenge the long-standing notion that subclinical hypothyroidism or thyroid 
autoimmunity are risk factors for gestational diabetes and support both the risk 
profile for gestational thyroid dysfunction and ongoing efforts on optimisation 
of treatment targets for pregnant people taking levothyroxine. Follow-up studies 
are required to establish to what extent levothyroxine initiation or dose 
adjustments can affect insulin resistance and antihyperglycaemic therapies 
during pregnancy.

INTRODUCTION: Thoracospinal deformities in early onset scoliosis (EOS) patients 
often lead to thoracic insufficiency syndrome, in which respiration or lung 
growth is impaired. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are used to assess pulmonary 
deficits but are challenging to comply with for EOS patients, who typically are 
between 5 and 10 years old. Thus, the objective was to predict PFT values in EOS 
patients directly from deformity parameters measured on routine radiographs.
METHODS: Corresponding preoperative radiographs and PFT values were 
retrospectively obtained from 47 EOS patients (13M/34F; mean age: 9.8 ± 3.0 
years), and 19 literature-based deformity parameters were measured. Multiple 
linear regression (MLR) analyses using an exhaustive search feature selection 
method were used to estimate percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) and 
forced expiratory volume in one second (%FEV1). Ten percent of the dataset was 
set aside to validate the predictive accuracy of the MLR models.
RESULTS: The additive contributions of multiple thoracospinal deformity 
parameters successfully yielded significant (p < 0.001) MLR models that 
predicted %FVC (R2 = 0.54) and %FEV1 (R2 = 0.59) in EOS patients. For the 
validation test, no significant differences (p > 0.05) in prediction error 
magnitudes were found.
CONCLUSION: The developed MLR models provide the highest reported precision for 
predicting PFT values in EOS patients from radiographic deformity parameters. 
Additionally, a key subset of deformity parameters was identified, and their 
relative contributions to predicting PFT values provide quantitative metrics to 
guide surgical treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Clinical outcome measures for autoimmune encephalitis (AE) are not 
yet well defined. Cognitive outcome measures (CogOs) and patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) may capture the symptoms of AE, beyond clinician-reported 
outcomes (ClinROs) (the Modified Rankin Scale [mRS] and Clinical Assessment 
Scale in Autoimmune Encephalitis [CASE]).
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study examined LGI-1-IgG AE patients at 
Cleveland Clinic. CogOs included the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) 
and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT). PROs included Neuro-QoL, PROMIS 
Global Physical (GPH) and Mental Health (GMH). Abnormal RAVLT, BVMT (≤ -1.5 SD), 
Neuro-QoL, and PROMIS (≥ 10 T-scores) proportions were analyzed. CogOs and PROs 
were correlated with ClinROs using Spearman's rank correlation.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients (64% male, mean age 68 [SD = 11], median follow-up 
19 months) were included. ClinROs improved, with median mRS decreasing from 2.5 
(IQR = 2-3) to 2 (IQR = 1-2), and CASE from 5 (IQR = 3-6) to 3 (IQR = 2-3) (all 
p < 0.05). RAVLT (n = 15), BVMT (n = 16), Neuro-QoL (n = 21), and PROMIS 
(n = 34) were available. At > 12 months from diagnosis, cognition was impaired 
on BVMT (56%) and RAVLT (20%). PROs showed impairments in Neuro-QoL lower (38%) 
and upper (27%) extremity function, cognition (31%), and PROMIS-GPH (25%). RAVLT 
correlated with Neuro-QoL cognition, depression, and stigma, while BVMT 
correlated with PROMIS-GMH (all unadjusted p < 0.05). Neither RAVLT nor BVMT 
correlated with ClinROs. ClinROs correlated with Neuro-QoL lower extremity 
function, cognition, and social roles (all p < 0.05).
INTERPRETATION: LGI-1-IgG AE patients have long-term impairments in cognition, 
physical health, and social roles, which can be objectively measured using CogOs 
and PROs and are not captured by ClinROs.

BACKGROUND: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in clinical contexts but 
can generate false facts (often referred to as "hallucinations"). One subset of 
these errors arises from adversarial attacks, in which fabricated details 
embedded in prompts lead the model to produce or elaborate on the false 
information. We embedded fabricated content in clinical prompts to elicit 
adversarial hallucination attacks in multiple large language models. We 
quantified how often they elaborated on false details and tested whether a 
specialized mitigation prompt or altered temperature settings reduced errors.
METHODS: We created 300 physician-validated simulated vignettes, each containing 
one fabricated detail (a laboratory test, a physical or radiological sign, or a 
medical condition). Each vignette was presented in short and long 
versions-differing only in word count but identical in medical content. We 
tested six LLMs under three conditions: default (standard settings), mitigating 
prompt (designed to reduce hallucinations), and temperature 0 (deterministic 
output with maximum response certainty), generating 5,400 outputs. If a model 
elaborated on the fabricated detail, the case was classified as a 
"hallucination".
RESULTS: Hallucination rates range from 50 % to 82 % across models and prompting 
methods. Prompt-based mitigation lowers the overall hallucination rate (mean 
across all models) from 66 % to 44 % (p < 0.001). For the best-performing model, 
GPT-4o, rates decline from 53 % to 23 % (p < 0.001). Temperature adjustments 
offer no significant improvement. Short vignettes show slightly higher odds of 
hallucination.
CONCLUSIONS: LLMs are highly susceptible to adversarial hallucination attacks, 
frequently generating false clinical details that pose risks when used without 
safeguards. While prompt engineering reduces errors, it does not eliminate them.

Plain Language Summary: Large language models (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are 
artificial intelligence-based computer programs that generate text based on 
information they are provided to train from. We test six large language models 
with 300 pieces of text similar to those written by doctors as clinical notes, 
but containing a single fake lab value, sign, or disease. We find that the LLM 
models repeat or elaborate on the planted error in up to 83 % of cases. Adopting 
strategies to prevent the impact of inappropriate instructions can half the rate 
but does not eliminate the risk of errors remaining. Our results highlight that 
caution should be taken when using LLM to interpret clinical notes.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Shoulder arthroplasty (SA) is an effective surgical procedure 
to treat advanced degenerative conditions of the shoulder as well as tumors or 
fractures of the proximal humerus. Utilization of SA is increasing in the United 
States as indications have expanded, however, health care disparities around 
utilization and clinical outcomes following SA also exist. This review examines 
current literature on patient related health care disparities in SA.
RECENT FINDINGS: Within SA, patient related health care disparities are highly 
influenced by race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, geography, and patient sex. 
Short term clinical outcomes show that Non-White patients experience lower 
utilization of SA, longer hospital stays, higher complications, and increased 
readmissions. Sex related disparities demonstrate that female patients have a 
longer interval between initial consultation and surgery. Additionally, females 
experience lower functional scores and higher rates of perioperative fractures 
than males. In the current era of value-based care, wide disparities in early 
postoperative outcomes increase the cost of healthcare to both patients and 
health systems. Disparities in SA remain underexplored compared to other health 
topics. Existing literature highlights suboptimal outcomes in racially, 
ethnically, or socially disadvantaged groups. Active awareness and recognition 
of healthcare disparities are required to renew and strengthen initiatives to 
deliver more equitable care after SA.

The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly expanding and has the 
potential to significantly impact the practice of sleep medicine. Sleep 
practitioners may be able to augment the efficiency and effectiveness of care 
delivery to patients by incorporating AI into clinical practice. However, AI 
must be implemented in a responsible manner, with a full appreciation of the 
technology's current limitations and evolving nature. Specifically, the tenets 
of data privacy, fairness and transparency, infrastructure and medical-legal 
issues must be considered. Many of these issues are evolving and will continue 
to impact AI implementation in new ways. Enhancements in technology will provide 
new AI options for clinicians and patients. Evolving case law will influence the 
legal risks that clinicians, hospitals and sleep centers will face. Creation of 
new policies within the U.S. and internationally will provide frameworks and 
safeguards for data privacy and AI use. Sleep clinicians and researchers should 
remain updated and knowledgeable in these areas. As AI continues to develop and 
advance in the sleep medicine field, it must be a partner to, and not a 
replacement for, clinician (i.e., human) oversight. It is the position of the 
AASM that responsible AI integration into sleep medicine has the potential to 
enhance clinical care and research but requires careful consideration to 
overcome clinical validation challenges, ensure ongoing accuracy after 
implementation, and incorporate clinically relevant and user-friendly tools into 
practice, while also upholding standards of safety, appropriateness, and 
transparency.

BACKGROUND: Not only are diagnosis and management of spontaneous intracranial 
hypotension (SIH) challenging due to heterogeneous symptoms and limited 
treatment effectiveness, but SIH's impact on health-related quality of life 
(HRQoL) is under-documented.
OBJECTIVES: In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate the assessment of QoL 
in SIH patients, identify impacted QoL domains, and explore treatment-related 
changes in QoL with a meta-analysis.
METHODS: Following PRISMA recommendations, we conducted a systematic literature 
search using a comprehensive set of keywords related to QoL and SIH. Databases 
were searched from the inception to July 2025. Studies were included if they 
provided reports on the quality of life for SIH patients. A meta-analysis using 
mean difference (MD) of baseline and after-treatment QoL scores was conducted. 
The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.
RESULTS: Of 1435 initial publications, 20 studies met the inclusion criteria, 
representing a total of 1106 patients with SIH. EQ-5D-5L and HIT-6 were the most 
frequently used tools, with pooled results showing significant improvement 
post-treatment in perceived health (Visual analog scale score improved from 38.9 
to 72.2; MD of 42.4 [95% CI 26.2-58.7]) and headache impact (HIT-6 scores 
improved from 66.1 to 49.3; MD of 20.1 [95% CI: 14.7-25.6]). Despite treatment, 
studies reported moderate to severe physical, mental, and social limitations.
DISCUSSION: The reporting of QoL is inconsistent and the tools used to assess 
QoL in SIH patients are heterogenous. While treatment provides help, some 
symptoms persist and highlight the need for specific QoL assessment, with tools 
tailored to SIH.

Over the past five years, transvenous (TV) techniques have rapidly expanded the 
neurointerventional landscape, offering new diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies for a range of cerebrovascular conditions. This narrative review 
synthesizes contemporary evidence and technical advances across multiple venous 
applications, including TV embolization for arteriovenous malformations and 
dural fistulas, treatment of cerebrospinal fluid-venous fistulas, and venous 
sinus stenting for pulsatile tinnitus, intracranial hypertension, and skull-base 
leaks. Recent data underscore high efficacy rates and favorable safety profiles 
in carefully selected patients, often matching or surpassing traditional 
arterial approaches. Innovations such as fetal vein of Galen embolization, 
vein-targeted brain-computer interface implantation, and endovascular 
cerebrospinal fluid shunting exemplify the therapeutic versatility of venous 
access. However, procedural challenges, such as venous anatomy, access, and 
embolic control, require meticulous planning and advanced skillsets. Trials like 
TATAM and DIVE-IIN are and will shape evidence-based indications for TV therapy. 
With expanding indications and growing operator expertise, the venous route is 
evolving from a niche adjunct into a cornerstone of neurovascular 
care.ABBREVIATIONS: bAVM(s)＝ brain arteriovenous malformation(s); CVF(s)＝

BACKGROUND: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) translate neural activity into 
real-world commands. While traditional invasive BCIs necessitate craniotomy, 
endovascular BCIs offer a minimally invasive alternative using the venous system 
for electrode placement.
NEW METHOD: This systematic review evaluates the technical feasibility, safety, 
and clinical outcomes of endovascular BCIs, discussing their future 
implications. A systematic review was conducted per PRISMA guidelines. The 
search spanned PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases using keywords 
related to neural interfaces and endovascular approaches. Studies were included 
if they reported on endovascular BCIs in preclinical or clinical settings. Dual 
independent screening and extraction focused on electrode material, recording 
capabilities, safety parameters, and clinical efficacy.
RESULTS: From 1385 initial publications, 26 met the inclusion criteria. 
Seventeen studies investigated the Stentrode device. Among the 24 preclinical 
studies, 16 used ovine or rodent models, and 9 addressed engineering or 
simulation aspects. Two clinical studies reported six ALS patients successfully 
using an endovascular BCI for digital communication. Preclinical data 
established the endovascular ovine model, demonstrating stable neural recordings 
and vascular changes with long-term implantation. Key challenges include 
thrombosis risk, long-term electrode stability, and anatomical variability.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Endovascular BCI reduced invasiveness, 
improved safety profiles, with comparable neural recording fidelity to invasive 
methods, and promising preliminary clinical outcomes in severely paralyzed 
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Early results are promising, but clinical data remain scarce. 
Further research is needed to optimize signal processing, enhance electrode 
biocompatibility, and refine endovascular procedures for broader clinical 
applications.

Rationale: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) represents an effective 
therapeutic strategy for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); 
however, local and systemic recurrences represent ongoing challenges. Computed 
tomography (CT) radiomics-based risk models can potentially be used to predict 
the risk of local recurrence on pretreatment CT scans. Objective: Development of 
a radiomics model to predict local recurrence after SBRT in patients with NSCLC. 
Methods: This single-institution study includes a retrospective case-control 
training set (20 patients with local recurrence and 40 control subjects) and an 
independent validation set (198 consecutive cases) of patients with early-stage 
NSCLC treated with SBRT. Tumors were semiautomatically segmented, and 102 
quantitative radiomic features, including texture, landscape, spatial, nodule 
shape, and nodule surface features, were extracted. These features were included 
in three separate multivariable models to predict the risk of recurrence on the 
basis of pre-SBRT, post-SBRT, and the difference between the pre-SBRT and 
post-SBRT scans (Delta model). The pre-SBRT model was subsequently validated in 
an independent validation set. Results: Thirteen independent variables were 
selected for the models using the Boruta algorithm. The sensitivity, 
specificity, and area under the curve of the pre-SBRT, post-SBRT, and Delta 
models were 85%, 90%, and 0.91; 85%, 92.5%, and 0.92; and 85%, 92.5%, and 0.94, 
respectively. The pre-SBRT model was validated in the independent validation set 
(area under the curve, 0.89; confidence interval, 0.83-0.92), because this model 
was believed to be the most useful to assist in individualized treatment 
planning. Conclusions: Radiomic analysis facilitated the development of three 
high-performing models predicting local recurrence using either pre-SBRT CT, 
post-SBRT CT, or the change between these two. We successfully validated the 
most clinically relevant model, the pre-SBRT model. Although this model needs 
further validation, it may facilitate individualized surveillance, treatment 
planning, and selection of adjuvant therapy.

for Lateral Epicondylitis: A High Dose Is Critical for a Positive Response: A 
Systematic Review and Meta-analysis With Meta-regression.

BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of 
platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for the management of lateral epicondylitis (LE) have 
been characterized by substantial variability in reported outcomes. The source 
of this heterogeneity is uncertain.
PURPOSE: To determine the effect of estimated platelet concentration on the 
efficacy of PRP for the management of LE.
STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis; Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS: All RCTs evaluating the efficacy of PRP in managing LE were identified. 
RCTs were classified according to whether the study documented a platelet 
concentration factor of PRP representing a greater than 3-fold increase over 
whole blood or a supraphysiological platelet dose (high-dose vs low-dose PRP). 
The primary outcome was the mean difference (MD) in the visual analog scale 
(VAS) score at latest follow-up. Random-effects and mixed-effects meta-analyses 
were performed, and meta-regression was used to evaluate whether differences in 
outcomes after treatment with PRP could be explained by differences in the 
concentration of PRP used.
RESULTS: Overall, 13 RCTs with a total of 791 patients were included in this 
analysis, with 5 that utilized low-dose PRP and 8 that used high-dose PRP. 
Meta-analysis of VAS scores reported by studies that used high-dose PRP resulted 
in an MD of -1.31 (95% CI, -1.87 to -0.75) in favor of PRP over all alternative 
treatment strategies (P < .001). Meta-analysis of VAS scores reported by studies 
that used low-dose PRP resulted in an MD of 0.08 (95% CI, -0.51 to 0.68), 
suggesting no difference in the effect between PRP and all alternative treatment 
strategies (P = .79). The platelet concentration factor of PRP used in each RCT 
was found to be strongly predictive of the VAS score at final follow-up in 
meta-regression (P < .001), with 58.5% of the heterogeneity in the outcomes of 
PRP between studies explained by the platelet concentration factor alone.
CONCLUSION: The platelet concentration of PRP may play a significant role in the 
outcomes of patients with LE. A direct linear relationship was observed between 
the platelet concentration factor of PRP used and the magnitude of 
patient-reported symptom relief after the management of LE with PRP. Clinicians 
should ensure a supraphysiological platelet concentration when preparing PRP for 
the management of LE.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the available literature on the relationship between knee 
bony morphology and medial meniscus posterior root tears (MMPRTs) to determine 
which tibiofemoral morphologic risk factors may predispose the development of 
MMPRTs.
METHODS: Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases were searched to identify all 
relevant human clinical studies investigating knee morphologic features and 
MMPRTs. Shape features were compared between control groups and patients with 
MMPRTs. The methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS) instrument 
was utilized to assess the methodological quality of included studies.
RESULTS: Thirteen level III evidence studies and 1 level IV evidence study were 
included in this review (n = 2,181), with 895 patients in the MMPRT group and 
1,286 in the control group. Tibial morphology features associated with an 
increased risk for MMPRTs included an increased medial tibial slope (6 studies), 
increased tibial torsion (1 study), increased medial meniscal slope (1 study), 
and shallower medial tibial plateau concavity (1 study). Varus mechanical 
alignment was found to increase the risk for MMPRTs (4 studies). Femoral 
morphology features associated with an increased risk for MMPRTs included an 
A-type intercondylar notch (1 study), increased medial femoral condyle (MFC) 
angle (1 study), narrower intercondylar distance (1 study), narrower 
intercondylar notch width (1 study), shorter MFC distal offset distance (1 
study), increased MFC width (1 study), increased MFC to medial tibial condyle 
width ratio (1 study), greater distance between the medial tibial eminence and 
MFC (1 study), and smaller femoral offset ratios of both the medial and lateral 
condyles (1 study).
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple tibiofemoral shape features, including a steeper slope of 
the medial tibial plateau, greater varus alignment, and a narrower intercondylar 
distance and notch width, were found to be predictive factors for MMPRTs.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level III and IV studies.

BACKGROUND: Although telehealth cardiac rehabilitation (CR) may improve access, 
there are concerns about its long-term effectiveness and impact on equity as 
compared with in-person CR. Our objective was to tailor a patient-centered 
telehealth CR program for diverse populations.
METHODS: CR patients and caregivers were recruited between January and September 
2023 from 4 US academic medical centers. Participants engaged in human-centered 
design sessions to iteratively refine a telehealth CR program. Sessions had 
planned topics, but there was variation across sites to account for 
site-specific needs and participant feedback. Sessions were qualitatively 
analyzed using rapid template analysis with preselected behavioral science 
constructs and other emergent codes.
RESULTS: The study included 21 participants (71% aged ≥60 years, 48% women, 62% 
non-Hispanic White individuals; 90% CR patients, 10% CR caregivers). 
Participants thought that telehealth CR could be helpful for personalized 
support at home and convenience but recognized that technology is not always 
easy to use. Some expressed concerns about the safety of telehealth CR, 
especially at the beginning, and desired monitoring through a mobile device or 
video observation of exercise. Safety protocols and technology training were 
developed, which addressed concerns about telehealth CR. Opportunities for 
social support with telehealth CR were also desired. From these findings, an 
implementation toolkit was developed, including a graphic program description, 
safety plan, home exercise plan for during and after CR, and scripts for 
technology training and individual and group telehealth visits.
CONCLUSIONS: A patient-centered telehealth CR program and implementation toolkit 
were systematically tailored to address the needs of diverse populations.

Brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel) is a chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T) 
cell therapy approved for adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B-cell acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). We studied the impact of social determinants of 
health (SDoH) on outcomes of adults with B-ALL receiving brexu-cel. This 
retrospective analysis included adults (≥18 years) with R/R B-ALL treated with 
brexu-cel between 2021 and 2023. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated the 
association of race, ethnicity, and SDoH with progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS). 189 patients received brexu-cel and 57% were male. 
55% were non-Hispanic White, 30% Hispanic, 7% non-Hispanic Black, 6% 
Asian/Pacific Islander, and 2% other/unknown. 43% were referred from 
private/community-based practices and 35% lived 50 miles or greater from the CAR 
T center. Health insurance included public (47%) and private (41%). 31% had a 
high social deprivation index (SDI, 76-99th percentile). Black race was 
associated with worse OS (HR 3.48; 95% CI 1.01-12.03). There was no difference 
in PFS (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.50-2.10) or OS (HR 1.43; 95% CI 0.56-3.65) in Hispanic 
patients. Outcomes appear independent of SDoH and SDoH did not impact OS. We 
observed comparable outcomes to non-Hispanic patients.

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable mental disorder that affects 
millions of people worldwide. Our understanding of the genetic etiology and 
biological processes that underlie BD have greatly increased in recent years. 
Extensive progress has been made in identifying common variant signals for BD, 
and the polygenic score from the latest genome-wide association study (GWAS) may 
provide some clinical utility if combined with other risk factors for BD. The 
role of rare variation in BD remains to be determined, although genes annotated 
to common variant loci are shown to be enriched for rare variation. BD subtypes 
have been shown to differ in their genetic architecture, and as such, genetic 
studies across the subtypes of the BD spectrum will identify subtype-specific 
signals and reveal subtype-specific biological mechanisms. Despite this, 
subtype-specific GWAS sample sizes have not increased at the same rate as BD 
cases, and more concerted efforts are required to obtain this information for 
participants included in future BD GWASs. Moreover, assessment of culture, 
geography, and other systematic differences that may impact patient assessment 
will be necessary to ensure accurate inclusion of diverse ancestral groups and 
global representation in genetic studies of BD moving forward.

PURPOSE: Studies have demonstrated a higher lifetime risk of cancer in AIS 
patients compared to age-matched controls. An asynchronous slot scan feature 
with ultra-small angle tomosynthesis reconstruction recently became available at 
our institution. Thus, we aimed to compare the performance of this new 
technology to the existing biplanar slot scanner for scoliosis imaging using 
standard dose settings.
METHODS: All scoliosis patients under 18 years old from a single institution who 
underwent diagnostic imaging with both the asynchronous (True2Scale) and 
biplanar imaging system (EOS®) were included. Overall image quality was 
independently reviewed using a previously published method. Anthropomorphic 
phantom evaluations and dose measurements were conducted, with effective doses 
compared between systems. A computerized model based on phantom data estimated 
standardized patient effective doses.
RESULTS: 40 imaging studies from 20 patients met the inclusion criteria. ICC for 
overall image quality was 0.88, with weighted-Cohen's Kappa analysis showing 
very high agreement (κ = 0.873). On average, patients imaged with the 
asynchronous system received 0.23 ± 0.15 (median: 0.10) mSv in each study, while 
patients imaged with the biplanar system received 0.12 ± 0.05 (median: 
0.13) mSv. A bootstrap Welch's t-test showed a significant difference in mean 
radiation doses (p = 0.038, mean difference = 0.11 mSv, T2S higher than EOS). AP 
dose analysis showed no significant difference (p = 0.196), with the 
asynchronous system at 0.07 ± 0.03 (median: 0.07) mSv and biplanar at 
0.06 ± 0.02 (median: 0.05) mSv.
CONCLUSIONS: Both technologies with standard dose parameters provided comparable 
image quality. While the asynchronous system delivers slightly higher radiation 
doses, both systems expose patients to less than annual background radiation 
(3 mSv) and standard 2-view scoliosis imaging doses. Larger studies are 
warranted to confirm these pilot findings.

Does Vertebral Body Tethering Cause Coronal Hypermobility at Adjacent 
Noninstrumented Levels? A Preliminary Study.

Nugraha HK(1), Milbrandt TA, Larson AN.

Author information:
(1)Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

BACKGROUND: Fusion into the lumbar spine with lower instrumented vertebra (LIV) 
of L2 and below can result in increased mobility or hypermobility of the unfused 
segments, potentially contributing to early disk and joint wear and subsequent 
degenerative arthritis. Vertebral body tethering (VBT) is a motion-preserving 
surgery for scoliosis, but no data is available about its effect on disk motion 
for the uninstrumented segments distal to the LIV. We hypothesize that VBT 
preserves the coronal arc of motion distal to the LIV in AIS patients without 
the development of hypermobility which has been observed following fusion 
surgery.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective review was completed of adolescent 
idiopathic scoliosis patients who underwent VBT. Standing bending films were 
collected as standard of care preoperatively and at 1-year postoperatively with 
maximum effort on side bending according to an institutional protocol. To 
evaluate the coronal arc of motion, radiographic measurement of the 
intervertebral angles was measured at each level from the disk directly distal 
to LIV-S1, as described in previous literature.
RESULTS: A total of 95 patients had clinical preoperative and postoperative 
bending radiographs and were included in the study. In total, there were 2086 
segments measured. Sixteen patients had bilateral tether procedures and were 
analyzed separately. Compared with preoperative values over the same levels, 
paired t test showed no significant difference in the coronal arc of motion for 
the distal uninstrumented segments.
CONCLUSIONS: Normal segmental motion on lateral bend was preserved on the 
noninstrumented segments following VBT. In contrast to fusion, there was no 
evidence of lumbar hypermobility following VBT in scoliosis patients. This 
provides early evidence for preserved normal motion which could be protective 
against adjacent segment disease and early arthritis reported with long fusions.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III-retrospective cohort study.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive simulation curriculum requires 
multiple simulators given the variety of ultrasound-guided procedures performed 
today. To address this issue, we have previously created and validated a novel 
set of task trainers and targeting curriculum that focuses on the core guidance 
skills used in all procedures. Here we report our experience with modified task 
trainers and curriculum in radiology residents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: First-year diagnostic radiology and diagnostic 
radiology/interventional radiology residents performed a pre-test on a 
modification of the previously described targeting tasks. Residents were 
randomized to either receive 3 weekly 1-hour training sessions with the trainers 
or no additional training. All residents then performed a post-test. The number 
of errors and error-adjusted completion time were compared for both the pre- and 
post-test between groups for all three tasks using an independent measures 
t-test.
RESULTS: 12 residents were randomized to the control group and 14 to the 
training group. On the pre-test, there were no significant differences between 
groups on any of the three targeting tasks. On the post-test, the total errors 
and error-adjusted completion times were significantly lower in the training 
group compared to the control group for all three targeting tasks.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that regular training improves targeting 
task performance in radiology residents. This group of trainees are of 
particular importance, as the greatest number and the widest variety of these 
procedures are performed by radiologists. Additional work is needed to determine 
if this training improves performance with real-life procedures.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized therapy for 
relapsed/refractory (R/R) Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Some patients discontinue ICIs 
after initial response or owing to immune-related adverse events (AEs). Efficacy 
and safety of ICI rechallenge, defined as reintroducing ICIs after previous 
discontinuation, remain unclear. A systematic literature search was performed 
through 10 January 2025, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42023403204). Studies 
reporting outcomes of ICI rechallenge in patients with R/R HL were included. 
Data on overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR) rate, 
progression-free survival (PFS), and treatment-related AEs were extracted. 
Pooled response rates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A 
total of 207 patients from 17 studies were included. The pooled ORR was 63% (95% 
CI, 55-70) with a CR rate of 43% (95% CI, 35-52). Median PFS after rechallenge 
was 13.3 months (95% CI, 7.9-18.8). Any-grade and grade 3 to 5 AEs occurred in 
47% (95% CI, 17-80) and 31% (95% CI, 23-40), respectively. ICI rechallenge in 
R/R classic HL can lead to high response rates and durable remissions comparable 
with uninterrupted ICI therapy with acceptable safety profiles. This strategy 
may be a viable option, although careful patient selection and monitoring are 
still necessary.

There is an increased clinical use of elbow orthoses. It is important to 
consider patient experiences in their use. Patient-reported outcome measures 
(PROMs) serve as essential tools for gathering patient perspectives. This review 
provides a comprehensive list of PROMs used in clinical trials of elbow 
orthoses, and documents their properties, uses, and quality. A systematic 
literature search across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and 
Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science identified 31 clinical trials of 
elbow orthoses that used PROMs as outcome measures. Subsequently, manual 
searches were conducted to report on each PROM's characteristics. A total of 15 
different PROMs were used as outcome measurements in clinical trials that used 
an elbow orthosis as an intervention for 11 different conditions. Researchers 
can use this review to aid in making informed decisions about which PROMs to use 
for future clinical trials.

Studies on human and animal models have demonstrated a complex molecular 
regulatory network between the dental mesenchyme and epithelium governing tooth 
development. However, epigenetic regulation of tooth development is largely 
unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between epigenetic 
modifiers and dental root development using mice deficient in Hdac3 under the 
control of the osterix promoter (Osx-Cre/Hdac3fl/fl or Hdac3-CKOosx). We 
observed tooth root size and histology in Hdac3-CKOosx mice. Dental pulp 
progenitor cells were isolated from lower incisors, and calcification and gene 
expression were assessed. Hdac3 depletion in osterix-expressing dental pulp stem 
cells, including odontoblasts, caused a progressive postnatal obstruction, 
resulting in relatively short roots and small root apices of the first molar. 
Mild degeneration was observed during the development of dentin and cementum 
structures. Dentin and cementum had uneven borders and showed disordered 
hematoxylin and eosin staining in Hdac3-CKOosx mice that had a thin cementum 
compared to that of WT mice. Hdac3 inhibition/deletion in dental pulp stem cells 
probably influenced Msx1 and Col1a1 expression in the early developmental stage, 
thereby driving differentiation in dental pulp progenitor cells. Subsequently, 
Msh homeobox 1 (Msx1), Col1a1, and osteocalcin expression were remarkably 
downregulated during calcification. Deletion or inhibition of Hdac3 in 
conditional KO dental pulp stem cells cultured in mineralization medium resulted 
in aberrant cell cycle control, and the early stages of maturation of dental 
pulp progenitor cells and odontoblasts were inhibited. Inhibition of Hdac3 in 
cementocytes also restricted their proliferation and calcification. These 
results suggested that the deletion or inhibition of Hdac3 in the dental 
mesenchyme may cause development and maturation deficiency of tooth root.

Plain Language Summary: Nongenetic (so-called epigenetic) regulation of tooth 
development remains largely unexplored. Histone deacetylase 3 (Hdac3) regulates 
epigenetic events and plays a key role in bone mineralization. However, the 
relationship between Hdac3 and tooth development is not well understood. In this 
study, the loss of Hdac3 caused mild degeneration in dentin and cementum 
structures of teeth, resulting in malocclusion in the incisor and relatively 
short roots and small root apices in the first molar of mice. Furthermore, in 
vitro experiments suggested that Hdac3 is important for development and 
maturation of healthy tooth roots.

BACKGROUND: Whether frail, elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) on a 
vitamin K antagonist (VKA) should switch to a direct-acting oral anticoagulant 
(DOAC) was studied in the FRAIL-AF trial and remains controversial.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in the COMBINE-AF data 
set, the impact on clinical outcomes of switching frail, elderly AF patients 
from VKA to DOAC.
METHODS: COMBINE-AF consists of individual patient-level data from 71,683 
patients with AF in 4 randomized clinical trials comparing DOAC vs warfarin. 
Frailty was evaluated using a frailty index derived from a modified Rockwood's 
Accumulation Model including 18 age-related conditions. Patients with a frailty 
index score above the median were considered frail. Prespecified outcomes were 
stroke or systemic embolic events, bleeding events, death, and a net clinical 
outcome combining these events.
RESULTS: We identified 5,913 patients who were frail, elderly (age ≥75 years), 
and VKA-experienced and 52,721 patients who did not meet all 3 of these 
criteria. Patients were randomized to a standard-dose (SD) DOAC or warfarin. 
After 27 months median follow-up, there was no heterogeneity in treatment effect 
with SD-DOAC vs warfarin among those who met all 3 criteria vs those who did not 
for the endpoints of stroke or systemic embolic events (HR: 0.83 vs 0.81; Pint = 
0.75) or for death (HR: 0.95 vs 0.91; Pint = 0.54). Major bleeding was similar 
with SD-DOAC vs warfarin in frail, elderly, VKA-experienced patients (HR: 1.06 
[95% CI: 0.90-1.25]), while it was significantly reduced with SD-DOAC in 
patients without all 3 criteria (HR: 0.82 [95% CI: 0.76-0.89]; Pint = 0.007). 
Likewise, the net clinical outcome was similar in the frail, elderly, 
VKA-experienced patients with SD-DOAC vs warfarin (HR: 1.01 [95% CI: 
0.91-1.13]), while significantly reduced with SD-DOAC patients without all 3 
criteria (HR: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.85-0.93]; Pint = 0.028). Fatal and intracranial 
bleeding were significantly reduced with SD-DOAC in both subgroups to a similar 
degree (both Pint > 0.05), while gastrointestinal bleeding with SD-DOAC was 
increased to a greater degree in frail, elderly, VKA-experienced patients (HR: 
1.83 [95% CI: 1.42-2.36]) compared with those without all 3 criteria (HR: 1.23 
[95% CI: 1.09-1.39]; Pint = 0.006).
CONCLUSIONS: Frail, elderly, VKA-experienced patients with AF switched to 
SD-DOAC experienced significant reductions in stroke or systemic embolism, fatal 
and intracranial bleeding, and death. Gastrointestinal bleeding was increased 
with SD-DOAC, while major bleeding and the primary net clinical outcome were 
similar. Based on these findings, SD-DOAC is a reasonable choice for frail, 
elderly, VKA-experienced patients to reduce stroke and systemic embolism, death, 
and the most serious types of bleeding.

Glucose-6-phosphate (G6PD) deficiency is the most prevalent enzyme deficiency 
and is estimated to affect 400 million people. The patients are usually 
asymptomatic and diagnosed following hemolytic episodes triggered by oxidative 
stress. Another type of hemolytic anemia known as dehydrated hereditary 
stomatocytosis (DHSt) is estimated to affect less than 1 per 1,000,000 people. 
DHSt is caused by increased cation efflux and dehydration in red blood cells, 
which leads to decreased flexibility making them more vulnerable to lysis. 
Compared with G6PD, DHSt has a mild presentation, where most patients (84%) with 
isolated DHSt exhibit chronic hemolysis. Both diseases, G6PD deficiency and 
DHSt, are inherited hemolytic anemias and to the best of our knowledge have 
never been reported to coexist in the same patient. Herein, we present the first 
case of concurrent G6PD deficiency and DHS in a 4-month-old male. We discuss the 
clinical presentation and hematopathology findings from this patient as well as 
provide a comparison literature review. We believe this presentation will add to 
the current body of knowledge for these conditions and help to guide future 
investigation and management.

OBJECTIVES: Radiologist participation in multidisciplinary tumor board can be 
time-consuming and demanding, requiring substantial preparation. Anecdotally 
radiologist participation is felt to help identify discrepancies in previous 
interpretations; however, there are limited data assessing the actual impact of 
their tumor board review on patient management. This prospective study aims to 
evaluate how the reinterpretation of outside imaging and review at hepatobiliary 
tumor board (HBTB) affects the diagnosis and management of patients with 
hepatobiliary neoplasms.
METHODS: This prospective analysis included all patients presented at the weekly 
HBTB between 6/13/2023-6/25/2024. One radiologist reviewed the available reports 
of outside imaging, the local reinterpretation of outside imaging, the updated 
local imaging, and documented conclusions from discussion of the case at HBTB. 
HBTB included 4 radiologists who had reviewed each case. Discrepancies 
(presence/absence, number, and reasons for) were recorded. When discrepancies 
occurred, the impact on patient management (5-point Likert scale) was determined 
by two of the radiologists present at the HBTB in consensus, with input from 
clinicians if needed. A six-month follow-up was performed to confirm suspected 
diagnoses.
RESULTS: 208 cases (128 males, 104 chronic liver disease patients) were 
presented at HBTB. Disagreements in the detection or characterization of lesions 
were found in 59/208 (28.4%) of cases. A change in management occurred in 38/59 
(64.6%) of these discrepant cases. In cases with recorded discrepancies in which 
follow-up confirmation was available, the final interpretation was confirmed in 
34/41 (82.9%) of cases.
CONCLUSION: Our study found a discrepant interpretation in nearly one-third of 
cases presented at a weekly HBTB and a resultant change in management in 65% of 
those cases. These findings highlight the importance of reinterpretation of 
prior imaging studies and the presence of radiologists at HBTB to guide optimal 
patient management.
KEY MESSAGE: Patient care is substantially impacted by reinterpretation of prior 
imaging and participation of radiologists at hepatobiliary tumor board.

BACKGROUND: A recently proposed staging system for folliculotropic mycosis 
fungoides (FMF) used clinical and histopathologic data to define 2 prognostic 
classes (ie early, advanced) for plaque-stage disease.
OBJECTIVE: In this external retrospective single-center cohort, we assessed the 
prognostic ability of the proposed re-classification system and high-risk 
histopathologic features overall.
METHODS: Patients with FMF were staged clinically. Skin biopsy specimens were 
reviewed for high-risk features. Patients with plaque-stage FMF were 
subcategorized as having early or advanced disease.
RESULTS: Of 81 patients with FMF (early-stage, n = 43; advanced-stage, n = 38), 
40 had plaque-stage FMF (early plaque-stage, n = 24; advanced plaque-stage, n = 
16). There was no difference in overall survival between early and advanced 
plaque-stage FMF. Of all cases, univariate analysis revealed associations 
between angioinvasion/angiodestruction and overall survival (hazard ratio, 6.04; 
95% CI, 1.88-19.42; P = .003) and disease-specific survival (hazard ratio, 7.17; 
95% CI, 1.76-29.33; P = .006), and between large cell transformation and 
disease-specific survival (hazard ratio, 4.91; 95% CI, 1.47-16.35; P = .010).
LIMITATIONS: Few disease-specific deaths in the plaque-stage subgroup precluded 
analysis of disease-specific survival.
CONCLUSION: In this cohort, addition of histopathologic data to subdivide 
plaque-stage FMF into early and advanced groups added no prognostic value. 
However, certain histopathologic features including 
angioinvasion/angiodestruction and large-cell transformation did offer 
prognostic power overall.

BACKGROUND: Guideline-directed device therapy for long QT syndrome (LQTS) has 
evolved during the years, and indications for an implantable 
cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) vary between professional cardiac societies.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify the subset of patients with LQTS who satisfied a 
class I or class II 2022 European Society of Cardiology guideline-based 
recommendation for an ICD and to determine the outcomes of those patients who 
received an ICD compared with those treated without an ICD.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted of 2861 patients with LQT1, LQT2, 
or LQT3 to identify patients meeting contemporary recommendations for 
guideline-directed device therapy. Basic demographics, clinical characteristics, 
and frequency/type of breakthrough cardiac events (BCEs) were extracted, and 
outcomes/complications were compared between patients treated with an ICD and 
those treated without one.
RESULTS: Of the 290 patients (approximately 10%) who met a guideline-based 
recommendation, 53 (18%) satisfied a class I/level B indication for an ICD; 56 
(19%), a class I/level C indication; 19 (7%), a class IIa/level C indication; 
and 162 (56%), a class IIb/level B indication. However, most patients (156/290 
[54%]) did not receive an ICD. Of those who received an ICD, 55 of 134 (41%) 
experienced ≥1 appropriate ventricular fibrillation-terminating ICD therapy, 
whereas ICD-related complications occurred in 13 patients (10%). Of those who 
were treated without an ICD, only 6 of 156 patients (4%) had nonlethal BCEs, 
which was significantly lower compared with the ICD group (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: With >1200 years of combined follow-up, the experience and evidence 
from our 2 LQTS specialty centers suggest that many patients who satisfy a 
recommendation for an ICD based on the latest 2022 European Society of 
Cardiology guidelines may not need one. This is particularly true when the 
indication stemmed from a BCE while receiving beta blocker therapy or in 
asymptomatic patients with an increased 1-2-3-LQTS-Risk score.

BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on anaphylaxis characteristics and outcomes in 
older adults.
OBJECTIVE: To compare triggers, presentation, management, and outcomes of 
anaphylaxis emergency department (ED) visits between older adults (≥65 y) and 
younger adults (18-64 y) in a prehospital setting and the ED.
METHODS: This cohort study included ED visits among adults meeting anaphylaxis 
diagnostic criteria from April 2008 to December 2022. Visit characteristics and 
outcomes were analyzed by age group using χ2 analysis and multivariable logistic 
regression.
RESULTS: Among 1,422 patient visits, 212 (14.9%) involved older adults. Compared 
with younger adults, visits among older adults were more likely to involve 
anaphylaxis from medications (34.0% vs 21.3%; odds ratio [OR] 1.85; 95% 
confidence interval [95% CI] 1.34-2.55) and intravenous contrast (13.2% vs 5.6%; 
OR 2.50; 95% CI 1.55-4.04). Older adult visits had increased odds of severe 
anaphylaxis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.57; 95% CI 1.12-2.21), including 
endotracheal intubation (aOR 6.24; 95% CI 2.69-14.48) and admission to the 
hospital or intensive care unit (aOR 1.78; 95% CI 1.19-2.67). Older adult visits 
were also more likely to arrive via Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (56.1% vs 
34.0%; OR 2.56; 95% CI 1.89-3.46), but less likely to receive EMS-administered 
epinephrine (26.0% vs 32.4%; aOR 0.46; 95% CI 0.27-0.77).
CONCLUSIONS: Visits among older adults had increased odds of anaphylaxis from 
medications and IV contrast, cardiovascular symptoms, and more severe outcomes, 
including intubation and intensive care unit admission. Improved EMS epinephrine 
administration and prehospital guidelines could enhance outcomes for older 
adults with anaphylaxis.

Carotid-cavernous dural arteriovenous fistulas causing debilitating ocular 
symptoms and/or retrograde cortical venous drainage necessitate curative 
treatment, which is achieved by disrupting the proximal draining vein. 
Transvenous embolization of carotid-cavernous dural arteriovenous fistulas can 
be achieved through the superior or inferior petrosal sinuses, facial veins, or 
superior ophthalmic veins.1, 2 However, if these approaches are not feasible, 
various percutaneous approaches have been described that use the skull base 
foramina to provide direct access to the cavernous sinus.3, 4 Here we present 
the case of a 54-year-old male with carotid-cavernous dural arteriovenous 
fistulas with cortical venous drainage causing diplopia that was cured using a 
percutaneous transorbital approach. We discuss the alternative endovascular 
strategies for treating carotid-cavernous dural arteriovenous fistulas and why 
they were not chosen, the technical nuances of the transorbital approach as well 
as the pearls and pitfalls of this seldom used technique. A comprehensive 
understanding of the many approaches for treating carotid-cavernous dural 
arteriovenous fistulas is important for neurointerventionalists.

Can artificial intelligence write science? A comparative analysis of 
human-written and artificial intelligence-generated scientific writings.

OBJECTIVE: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly capable of academic 
writing, with large language models such as ChatGPT showing potential to assist 
or even generate scientific manuscripts. However, concerns remain regarding the 
quality, reliability, and interpretive capabilities of AI-generated content. The 
authors' study aimed to compare the quality of a human-written versus an 
AI-generated scientific manuscript to evaluate the strengths and limitations of 
AI in the context of academic publishing.
METHODS: Two manuscripts were developed using identical titles, abstracts, and 
tables of a simulated analysis: one authored by a physician with multiple 
publications, and the other generated by ChatGPT-4o. Three independent and 
blinded reviewers-two human and one AI-assessed each manuscript across five 
domains: clarity and readability, coherence and flow, technical accuracy, depth, 
and conciseness and precision. Each category was scored on a 10-point scale, and 
qualitative feedback was collected to highlight specific strengths and 
weaknesses. Additionally, all reviewers were asked to deduce authorship of the 
manuscripts.
RESULTS: The AI-generated manuscript scored higher in clarity and readability 
(mean 9.0 vs 7.2), but lower in technical accuracy (mean 6.3 vs 9.3) and depth 
(mean 5.5 vs 7.5). However, reviewers noted that the AI version lacked depth, 
critical analysis, and contextual interpretation. All reviewers accurately 
identified the authorship of each manuscript and tended to rate the version more 
favorably when it aligned with their own origin (human or AI); i.e., human 
reviewers assigned higher scores to the human-written manuscript, while the AI 
reviewer scored the AI-generated manuscript higher.
CONCLUSIONS: Although AI models can improve some aspects of scientific writing, 
particularly clarity and readability, they fall short in critical reasoning and 
contextual understanding. This reinforces the importance of human authorship and 
oversight in maintaining the critical analysis and scientific accuracy essential 
for academic publishing. AI may be used as a complementary tool to support, 
rather than replace, human-led scientific writing.

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate influence of facet cysts on outcomes in 
patients undergoing lumbar decompression, and the influence of spinal fusion in 
patients undergoing decompression for facet cysts.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The impact of facet cysts on outcomes following 
lumbar spine surgery for degenerative spine disease remains unclear.
METHODS: Our multicenter institutional Neurosurgery Enterprise Registry was 
queried for patients who underwent lumbar decompression for degenerative spine 
conditions. Patients were divided into 2 cohorts: those with lumbar spine facet 
cysts and those without. Retrospective propensity-score matching was performed 
using 13 baseline variables to adjust for potential confounding factors, 
including age, sex, race, body mass index, and comorbidities. Secondary analysis 
comparing outcomes in patients with facet cysts cases undergoing decompression 
only versus those undergoing decompression and fusion was conducted.
RESULTS: A total of 6768 patients were reviewed, of which 188 (2.8%) had facet 
cysts, which underwent lumbar decompression during 2019-2023. After 3:1 
matching, patients with facet cysts were compared with 564 patients without it. 
We found no significant differences in LOS, nonroutine discharge, postoperative 
complications, readmissions, and reoperations. In addition, in cases with facet 
cysts, decompression reported no increased risk for discharge opioids, 
readmissions, and reoperations, whereas fusion (in a separate cohort of 127 
patients with facet cysts) was associated with an increased risk for nonroutine 
discharge (3.7% vs. 10.2%, P=0.021), complications (2.1% vs. 7.1%, P=0.042), and 
longer LOS (0.89±1.69 vs. 3.74±2.03 d, P<0.001) and operative time (138.78±62.99 
vs. 273.07±111.51 min, P <0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of facet cysts does not significantly affect outcomes 
of lumbar decompression for degenerative spine disease. Decompression alone for 
facet cysts can have better outcomes than decompression and fusion. The need for 
fusion should be weighted with its higher risks of complications, longer 
hospital stays, and nonroutine discharges.

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in humans 
and kills as many people annually as melanoma. The understanding of the 
transcriptional changes with respect to high-risk clinical/histopathologic 
features and outcome is poor. In this study, we examine stage-matched, 
outcome-differentiated cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma using whole-exome and 
transcriptome sequencing. Exome analysis identified key driver mutations, 
including TP53, CDKN2A, NOTCH1, SHC4, MIIP, CNOT1, C17orf66, LPHN2, and TTC16, 
and pathway enrichment of driver mutations in replicative senescence, cellular 
response to UV, cell-cell adhesion, and cell cycle. Transcriptomic analysis 
identified pathway enrichment of immune signaling/inflammation, cell-cycle 
pathways, extracellular matrix function, and chromatin function. Integrative 
analysis identified 183 critical genes in carcinogenesis and were used to 
develop a gene expression panel for outcome. Three outcome-related gene clusters 
included those involved in keratinization, cell division, and metabolism. We 
found 16 genes whose expressions may be associated with metastasis (risk score ≥ 
9 Met and risk score < 9 NoMet) with an area under the curve of 97.1%, 
sensitivity of 95.5%, specificity of 85.7%, and overall accuracy of 90%. Eleven 
genes were chosen to generate the risk score for overall survival, with an 
overall survival prediction of 80.8% and each risk gene increasing the risk of 
death by 2.47 (hazard ratio = 2.47, P < .001).

Pulmonary large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a rare, aggressive lung 
tumor marked by significant molecular heterogeneity. In a study of 590 patients 
across two independent cohorts, we observe comparable overall survival across 
treatment regimens (chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy, immunotherapy) without 
unexpected adverse events. Genomic analysis identifies distinct non-small cell 
lung cancer-like (NSCLC-like, KEAP1, KRAS, STK11 mutations) and SCLC-like (RB1, 
TP53 mutations) LCNEC subtypes, with 80% aligning with SCLC transcriptional 
profiles. Serial sampling reveals stable mutational but shifting transcriptomic 
landscapes over time. Here we show, elevated FGL-1 (a LAG-3 ligand) and SPINK1 
expression in NSCLC-like LCNECs, and higher levels of DLL3 in SCLC-like LCNECs. 
Immunofluorescence confirms FGL-1 expression in NSCLC-like LCNECs, and H&E slide 
analyses indicates fewer tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in LCNECs versus other 
lung cancers. These findings highlight LCNEC's distinct immunogenomic profile, 
supporting future investigations into LAG-3, SPINK1, and DLL3-targeted 
therapies.

The spectrum of kidney lesions associated with monoclonal gammopathy has 
significantly expanded over the past 2 decades, with description of new entities 
and variants of old entities. Pathologic diagnosis is challenging because of 
lesional complexity, heterogeneity, and reliance on electron microscopy and 
ancillary techniques. A lack of precise pathologic definitions and uniform 
terminology has hampered diagnostic accuracy. To address these challenges, the 
Renal Pathology Society and International Kidney and Monoclonal Gammopathy 
Research Group jointly tasked a working group of nephropathologists and 
nephrologists to establish consensus-based terminology and definitions for 
monoclonal gammopathy-associated kidney lesions. Participants included experts 
in the field with international representation. This report presents their 
recommendations. For each lesion, prerequisite (mandatory) diagnostic criteria 
and supportive (nonmandatory) features are proposed. New terminology is provided 
for some lesions. Application of standardized terminology and definitions should 
help harmonize kidney biopsy diagnosis with precision therapy in the monoclonal 
gammopathy-associated kidney disorders.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence, predictors, and prognostic implications 
of acute kidney injury (AKI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of the Mayo Clinic PCI registry 
identified 9199 patients who underwent PCI from January 1, 2009, through June 
30, 2023.
RESULTS: A total of 856 patients (9.3%) developed AKI (increase in serum 
creatinine level by ≥0.3 mg/dL or ≥1.5 times baseline), with 87 (0.9%) requiring 
hemodialysis. A monotonic increase in the yearly incidence of AKI was observed 
(P<.001). In multivariable analysis, AKI was associated with older age (odds 
ratio [OR], 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.02), female sex (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.08 to 
1.49), diabetes (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.89), congestive heart failure (OR, 
2.99; 95% CI, 2.54 to 3.52), chronic kidney disease (OR, 2.46; 95% CI, 2.00 to 
3.02), acute myocardial infarction (OR, 3.34; 95% CI, 2.80 to 3.99), 
intra-aortic balloon pump (OR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.55 to 4.73), and contrast volume 
(OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.41). In-hospital mortality was 11.1% vs 1.0% in 
patients with vs without AKI (P<.001). After adjustment, AKI remained strongly 
associated with in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio, 5.75; 95% CI, 4.06 to 
8.13). Among hospital survivors, 1-, 5-, and 10-year all-cause mortality, 
repeated revascularization, myocardial infarction, and major adverse 
cardiovascular event rates were significantly higher in those who developed AKI.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of AKI after PCI remains high in the contemporary 
era. Higher in-hospital and long-term mortality and adverse cardiac event rates 
were noted in patients who developed AKI after PCI.

BACKGROUND: Heparin is the standard anticoagulant used during cardiopulmonary 
bypass (CPB). However, there are problems with heparin, including immunogenicity 
and variability of effect, that make a search for an alternative desirable. 
Dabigatran anticoagulation has been reported to provide adequate conditions for 
CPB in a rabbit model. This study used a sheep model of CPB to assess the 
efficacy of dabigatran and its reversibility with idarucizumab.
METHODS: Twelve sheep were subjected to 120 min of CPB after anticoagulation 
with either intravenous dabigatran or heparin (N = 6 per group). In both groups, 
activated clotting time, kaolin/tissue factor-activated thromboelastography 
reaction time, and blood gases were monitored during and after CPB. Plasma 
dabigatran concentrations were measured during and after CPB. After CPB, two 
sections of each arterial filter were examined for thrombus using electron 
microscopy. Idarucizumab or protamine was administered after CPB to reverse 
anticoagulation, and the sheep were monitored for a subsequent 24 h. Plasma 
concentrations of inflammatory and coagulation markers were assessed at 
baseline, after 120 min of CPB, and 6 h after reversal administration.
RESULTS: After 120 min of CPB, there was no visible thrombus or fibrin observed 
on the arterial line filters in either the dabigatran or heparin groups. Plasma 
dabigatran concentrations during CPB were below the target concentration (5 
µg/ml), ranging from 1.7 ± 0.4 to 3.4 ± 1.5 µg/ml. In both groups, reaction time 
and activated clotting time values increased during CPB and then returned to 
nearly baseline levels after administration of the reversal agents. 
Interleukin-6 concentrations were elevated in the heparin group compared to the 
dabigatran group. Five sheep survived 24 h after idarucizumab administration. 
Four of six sheep survived 24 h after the administration of protamine.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that dabigatran effectively provides 
anticoagulation in a sheep CPB model, and idarucizumab successfully reverses its 
effects.

OBJECTIVE: Four hypertension-mediated left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) 
phenotypes have been reported using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR): normal LV, 
LV remodelling, eccentric and concentric LVH, with varying prognostic 
implications. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely used to detect LVH; 
however, its capacity to differentiate between LVH phenotypes is unknown. This 
study aimed to classify hypertension-mediated LVH from the ECG using machine 
learning and test for associations of ECG-predicted phenotypes with incident 
cardiovascular outcomes.
METHODS: ECG biomarkers were extracted from the 12-lead ECG of 20 439 
hypertensive patients in UK Biobank (UKB). Classification models integrating ECG 
and clinical variables were built using logistic regression, support vector 
machine (SVM), and random forest. The models were trained in 80% of the 
participants, and the remaining 20% formed the test set. External validation was 
sought in 877 hypertensive participants from the Study of Health in Pomerania 
(SHIP). In the UKB test set, we tested for associations between ECG-predicted 
LVH phenotypes and incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and heart 
failure.
RESULTS: Among UKB participants 19 408 had normal LV, 758 LV remodelling, 181 
eccentric and 92 concentric LVH. Classification performance of the three models 
was comparable in UKB. SVM (accuracy 0.79, sensitivity 0.59, specificity 0.87, 
AUC 0.69) was taken forward for external validation with similar results in 
SHIP. There was superior prediction of eccentric LVH in both cohorts. In the UKB 
test set, ECG-predicted eccentric LVH was associated with heart failure (hazard 
ratio 3.42, 95% CI 1.06-9.86).
CONCLUSION: ECG-based ML classifiers represent a potentially accessible 
screening strategy for the early detection of hypertension-mediated LVH 
phenotypes.

OBJECTIVES: To benchmark metabolomic signatures of inclusion body myositis (IBM) 
in muscle tissue, highlighting sex-specific differences and the correlation with 
clinical parameters.
METHODS: A total of 37 IBM patients and 22 controls without myopathy were 
included. All participants had bulk RNA sequencing performed previously. 
Clinical parameters included disease duration and manual muscle test (MMT) 
scores. Discovery metabolite screening and quantitative targeted metabolomics 
platforms were used. Levels of metabolites and RNA-metabolomic integrated 
modules were correlated with clinical parameters and the mitophagy marker, 
p-S65-Ubiquitin (p-S65-Ub).
RESULTS: IBM muscle samples showed elevated citric acid (TCA) cycle 
intermediates and anaplerotic amino acids. Proximal glycolytic intermediates 
were decreased, while pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) metabolites were 
increased. Short-chain acylcarnitines were lower in IBM males but not in 
females. Lastly, nucleic acid bases were increased, and nucleotides were 
decreased. MMT correlated with PPP metabolites and nucleic acid bases, and 
inversely correlated with glycolysis metabolites and mono/diphosphate 
nucleotides. MMT also correlated with several amino acids, including cysteine, 
taurine, carnosine, and sarcosine. Acylcarnitines correlated with disease 
duration only in males. Four RNA-metabolomic integrated modules demonstrated 
significant correlations. The strongest correlations were observed between the 
pink module and both sexes and p-S65-Ub. MMT and p-S65-Ub correlated with 3 and 
2 modules, respectively. The enriched pathways were related to central carbon 
metabolism, cytokine/chemokine signalling, neurotransmission, and 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/RAS signalling. Males had relatively 
similar correlations to the combined-sex analysis, while females had no 
significant correlation with any module.
CONCLUSIONS: IBM is associated with clinically significant alterations in 
central carbon metabolism, with the strongest RNA-metabolomic-clinical 
correlations observed in males. Further research is needed to explore the role 
of these metabolic changes in IBM pathogenesis and their progression over time.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming echocardiography, ushering in an 
era of improved diagnostic precision, efficiency and patient care. In this 
Review, we present an in-depth exploration of AI applications in 
echocardiography, highlighting the latest advances, practical implementations 
and future directions. We discuss the integration of AI throughout the 
echocardiographic workflow, from image acquisition and analysis to 
interpretation. We outline the potential of AI to automate routine measurements 
and calculations, enable task shifting, recognize disease-specific patterns and 
uncover new phenogroups that might surpass current diagnostic classifications. 
Moreover, we address the aspects needed to create trustworthy AI systems, 
through careful validation, navigating regulatory requirements and upholding 
ethical standards, thereby presenting a balanced perspective on the advantages 
and limitations of this rapidly evolving technology. Through an examination of 
current AI applications, clinical studies and technological breakthroughs, we 
offer a comprehensive understanding of the evolving role of AI in the future of 
echocardiography and its capacity to advance cardiovascular care, while also 
acknowledging the current limitations of the widespread clinical implementation 
of AI-supported echocardiography.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) with perinidal 
aneurysms and single draining vein are associated with an elevated risk of 
rupture and increased procedural complexity. The role of preoperative 
embolization in this high-risk anatomical subset remains unclear. This study 
aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of microsurgery with preoperative 
embolization, compared with microsurgery alone in patients with such AVMs.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective analysis of an AVM registry 
from the MISTA (Multicenter International Study for Treatment of Brain AVMs) 
consortium and included AVMs with perinidal aneurysms and a single draining 
vein. Baseline characteristics, angiographic outcomes, functional outcomes, and 
complication rates were compared. Propensity score weighting (PSW) using the 
covariate balancing method was applied to adjust for baseline differences.
RESULTS: Out of a total of 1919 patients, 65 met the inclusion criteria; 45 
patients underwent preoperative embolization followed by microsurgery, and 20 
underwent microsurgery alone. After adjustment, complete obliteration rates were 
similar between groups (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.04 to 16.33, P=0.92), as were rates of 
functional independence at discharge and follow-up. Overall complication, 
symptomatic complication, and mortality rates did not differ significantly 
between groups. However, permanent complications were significantly lower in 
patients with preoperative embolization (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.84, P=0.03).
DISCUSSION: In patients with AVMs featuring perinidal aneurysms and single 
draining vein, preoperative embolization followed by microsurgery was associated 
with fewer permanent complications and no increase in adverse outcomes compared 
with microsurgery alone. However, given the small number of events, this finding 
should be interpreted cautiously.

BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are complex vascular anomalies 
with a high risk of hemorrhage and neurological deficits, especially when 
located in eloquent brain regions. The eloquence of an AVM location is a 
critical factor in the treatment planning, influencing both the risk of 
complications and long-term functional outcomes. This study aims to compare 
outcomes between eloquent and non-eloquent AVMs.
METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study utilized data from the 
Multicenter International Study for Treatment of Brain AVMs (MISTA) consortium. 
Patients with eloquent and non-eloquent AVMs were compared on baseline 
characteristics, angiographic outcomes, and functional outcomes using the 
modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Propensity score weighting (IPTW) was applied to 
adjust for confounding variables.
RESULTS: The study included 1013 patients, with 498 (49.2%) AVMs located in 
eloquent regions and 515 (50.8%) in non-eloquent regions. In unadjusted 
analysis, eloquent AVMs had lower complete obliteration rates (67.6% vs 79.5%, 
OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.39-0.72, p < 0.001) and higher complication rates (24.5% vs 
19.0%, OR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.02-1.86, p = 0.03) compared to non-eloquent AVMs. 
After IPTW adjustment, eloquent AVMs continued to show significantly higher odds 
of overall complications (OR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.12-2.52, p = 0.01) and symptomatic 
complications (OR: 1.77, 95% CI: 1.12-2.80, p = 0.01). Secondary analysis within 
the eloquent group indicated that embolization was linked to an elevated risk of 
complications. Surgery and radiosurgery showed comparable functional outcomes at 
last follow-up and complications rates with higher complete obliteration rates 
in surgery.
CONCLUSION: AVMs in eloquent brain areas present higher risks of complications 
and lower obliteration rates, emphasizing the need for cautious, individualized 
treatment planning. Within the eloquent group, embolization increased the risk 
of complications, while surgery and radiosurgery showed comparable functional 
outcomes at last follow-up and complication rates with higher complete 
obliteration rates in surgery. These findings highlight the importance of 
location in AVM management and support further research focusing on comparing 
treatment strategies for AVMs in eloquent brain areas.

PURPOSE: In 2022, the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation 
(ABPMR) contracted with Professional Services Industries LLC to complete a 
Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) practice analysis. The goal was to 
develop an updated examination content outline that accurately depicts the 
knowledge and skills expected for a competent PRM physician following completion 
of training. The purpose of this paper is to describe the process of practice 
analysis and to present candidate perceptions of scope of practice and relevancy 
of content from the first two examinations in which the new outline was applied.
METHODS: The practice analysis process was undertaken in four distinct stages: 
subject matter expert meetings to determine the tasks and knowledge areas; the 
development, issuance and analysis of a national survey; development of exam 
specifications; and results verification. Results were analyzed by a 
psychometrician and team to determine mean relative importance of task and 
knowledge items. A new outline was then created and used for the administration 
of the 2023 and 2024 ABPMR PRM Certification Examinations.
RESULTS: All active board certified PRM physicians identified were sent surveys 
via e-mail. One hundred ninety six (61.1%) respondents completed the survey. The 
top five task statements in order of perceived importance were performing 
history and physical examinations, managing muscle and tone abnormalities, 
prescribing orthoses and equipment, prescribing therapy services, and making 
appropriate specialty care referrals. The top five knowledge statements in order 
of perceived importance were cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, abnormal growth 
and development, neuromuscular disorders, and musculoskeletal conditions. The 
new PRM Examination content outline created included six domains and 22 
subdomains of knowledge content areas. A higher percentage of initial 
certification candidates sitting for the 2023 and 2024 ABPMR PRM Certification 
Examinations selected "Strongly Agree" or "Agree" when responding to the 
examination content reflecting both scope of training and relevancy.
CONCLUSION: A practice analysis process was undertaken resulting in a new 
content outline for the ABPMR PRM Certification Examination. Following the 
implementation of the new content outline, initial certification candidate 
survey responses showed improved favorability regarding content reflecting scope 
of training and relevancy.

Patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, including multiple myeloma, AL 
amyloidosis, and monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance, face a high burden 
of end-stage kidney disease, which limits survival and quality of life. Although 
kidney transplantation offers potential benefits, it remains underused because 
of the high risk of recurrence and historically poor outcomes. A 
multidisciplinary panel of transplant nephrologists, hematologists/oncologists, 
and pathologists convened to evaluate contemporary evidence and evolving 
strategies in kidney transplant for plasma cell dyscrasias and end-stage kidney 
disease. Advances in plasma cell dyscrasia therapies are improving survival and 
expanding kidney transplant eligibility. However, key challenges remain, 
including optimizing hematologic response pre-kidney transplant and managing 
immunosuppression to mitigate recurrence and avoid infection complications. 
Ongoing research and multidisciplinary collaboration are essential to refine 
transplant selection, integrate biomarkers for risk stratification, and develop 
tailored post-kidney transplant surveillance. These efforts may increase access 
to kidney transplant and improve outcomes for patients with plasma cell 
dyscrasias and end-stage kidney disease.

The number needed to treat (NNT) has statistical and methodological limitations 
that make it unhelpful in the context of developing clinical practice guidelines 
and policy decisions. It is not unusual during the development of a clinical 
practice guideline that a panelist would ask the question: "What is the number 
needed to treat (NNT) for the intervention of interest?" In fact, NNTs are 
prominently cited in many clinical practice guidelines.[1-3] This question 
indicates that the panelist does not want to make a recommendation solely based 
on a relative effect (e.g., relative risk, odds ratio or hazard ratio), which is 
a good decision. This question indicates that the panelist is astutely 
interested in knowing the absolute effect of the intervention on an outcome in a 
population with a defined baseline risk. However, we argue that NNT is not a 
useful effect measure for decision-making, such as in developing clinical 
practice guidelines, policy decisions or health technology assessments, and we 
discourage its use in this context. Rather, the absolute risk difference (RD) is 
a much more appropriate measure.

ObjectivesGuidelines advise repeat screening within four months if Papanicolaou 
(Pap) results are unsatisfactory for evaluation. This utilizes healthcare system 
resources and may decrease patient satisfaction due to needing a second clinic 
appointment. We assessed unsatisfactory Pap test (UPT) rates and associations 
with clinician and patient characteristics to inform future interventions to 
decrease UPTs.SettingMultisite midwestern United States primary care 
practice.MethodsRetrospective analysis of women aged 21-65 with a Pap between 
7/1/2021 and 6/30/2023. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses 
were conducted to assess for associations between UPTs and clinician gender, 
degree, residency status, and experience.ResultsOf 51,195 Paps completed, 2.3% 
were unsatisfactory. Female clinicians performed the most Pap tests (83.2%) with 
slightly less likelihood of UPTs compared with male clinicians (p = 0.015). 
There was no significant difference comparing physicians to advanced practice 
providers in UPTs (p = 0.18). Residency training level did not affect UPT rates 
(p = 0.95). Clinician experience was associated with higher UPT rates in first 
and fourth quartiles (least and most Paps performed) compared to middle two 
quartiles (p = 0.004). UPTs were more likely among women aged  > 50 years old 
(p < 0.001), married (p < 0.001), and Asian (p < 0.001).ConclusionsClinician 
characteristics played a small role in predicting UPTs but patient age may be 
the factor most amenable to intervention to lower UPTs. Transitioning to primary 
human papillomavirus (HPV) screening in peri/post-menopausal women could 
decrease UPTs given Paps are performed on the clinician-collected cervical 
specimen only if HPV testing is positive.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Large clinical trials, including VISION, have 
established the safety of combining [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 with an androgen receptor 
pathway inhibitor (ARPI). Most patients receiving [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in the 
real-world setting have already progressed on an ARPI. This study aimed to 
assess the efficacy of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with and without the 
concurrent use of an ARPI.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the Mayo Clinic Rochester radiopharmaceutical 
database, focusing on patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate 
cancer (mCRPC) who had progressed after prior exposure to an ARPI and started 
treatment with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 between March 2022 and March 2023. Patients 
receiving concurrent ARPIs (abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or 
darolutamide) were identified. Baseline characteristics were compared using 
Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test. Outcomes of interest included 
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 50 response, median number of cycles, and 
overall survival (OS) from the start of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, analyzed using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates and multivariate Cox regression.
KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Among 256 patients, 106 (41.4%) received an ARPI 
with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. Those receiving an ARPI had lower baseline PSA levels 
(3.4 vs 29.7 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and lower rates of bone (77.4% vs 87.4%, 
p = 0.035) and visceral (18.9% vs 34%, p = 0.008) metastases. While patients on 
ARPIs were more likely to complete all six cycles of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (63.2% 
vs 48.7%, p < 0.001), PSA50 response rates were similar (49.1% vs 47.3%, 
p = 0.786). Median OS was longer with concurrent ARPI use (not reached vs 
15.3 mo, p < 0.001), but this difference was not significant on a multivariate 
analysis (hazard ratio = 1.03 [95% confidence interval: 0.68-1.55], p = 0.891) 
after accounting for baseline differences in other prognostic variables. 
Limitations include its single-center, retrospective design and a lack of 
standardized radiographic response assessment.
CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Among men with mCRPC previously exposed 
to an ARPI, continuation of the ARPI with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 did not improve 
PSA50 response rates or OS after adjusting for cohort imbalances in known 
prognostic factors. Further post hoc analyses using large clinical trial data 
are needed.

BACKGROUND: Minimum joint space width (mJSW) is an important continuous 
quantitative metric of osteoarthritis progression in the knee. The purpose of 
this study was to develop an automated measurement algorithm for mJSW in the 
medial and lateral compartments of the knee that can flexibly handle native 
knees and knees after arthroplasty.
METHODS: We developed an end-to-end algorithm consisting of a deep learning 
segmentation model plus a computer vision algorithm to measure mJSW in the 
medial and lateral compartments of the knee. Trained annotators segmented 583 
images to train, validate, and test a deep learning model that segments the 
relevant structures for the measurement of mJSW. Trained annotators measured 
mJSW in 330 independent images to provide ground truth measurements for the 
development and validation of the computer vision algorithm. Algorithm 
performance was measured by calculating mean absolute error and constructing the 
Bland-Altman plots.
RESULTS: The trained segmentation model performed with an average dice score of 
0.92 across all images and structures in the 50-image test set. The mean 
absolute error between the human measurements and the algorithm measurements was 
0.85 ± 1.20 mm. The mean error without taking the absolute value was 0.019 mm, 
demonstrating minimal bias toward overestimating or underestimating mJSW. Of the 
algorithm mJSW measurements, 73.2% were less than 1 mm and different from human 
measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated an automated algorithm for measuring 
mJSW on anteroposterior knee radiographs. This artificial intelligence-based 
algorithm for mJSW will streamline future population-level clinical research in 
the natural history of the knee joint and allow surgeons and physicians the 
ability to quickly measure a patient's entire longitudinal series of radiographs 
to quantitatively assess the radiographic progression of arthritis during clinic 
visits.

BACKGROUND: A drastic increase in the volume of primary total knee 
arthroplasties (TKAs) performed nationwide will inevitably lead to higher 
volumes of revision TKAs in which the primary knee implant must be removed. An 
important step in preoperative planning for revision TKA is implant 
identification, which is time-consuming and difficult even for experienced 
surgeons. We sought to develop a deep learning algorithm to automatically 
identify the most common models of primary TKA implants.
METHODS: We used an institutional total joint registry to pull images and 
implant data for 9,651 patients (N = 111,519 images). We trained a deep learning 
model based on the EfficientNet architecture to identify nine different TKA 
systems across all common knee radiographic views. Model performance was 
assessed on internal held-out test set and external test set. Conformal 
prediction was employed to provide uncertainty estimates, and an outlier 
detection system alerts the user if an image is potentially outside of the 
model's trained expertise.
RESULTS: The average model accuracy on the held-out test set was 99.7%. The 
outlier detection system flagged 93% of images in the test set which were marked 
as outliers during a manual clean of the dataset. On the external test set, the 
model made one error out of 301 images. The model can process approximately 30 
images/second.
CONCLUSION: We developed an automated knee implant identification tool that can 
classify nine different implant designs. Importantly, it works on multiple 
radiographic views and utilizes uncertainty quantification and outlier detection 
as safety mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) has lower response rates to 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) than invasive ductal carcinoma. While ILC often 
has low-risk biology, there is a high-risk subset within this heterogeneous 
tumor type. We compared surgical treatment and response rates by histology in 
I-SPY2, a multicenter NAC trial.
METHODS: We evaluated 1329 patients with stage II-III breast cancer and 
high-risk 70-gene assay. Patients with classic, pleomorphic, or mixed 
lobular/ductal histology were included in the lobular cohort. We evaluated rates 
of mastectomy, positive margins, axillary dissection, and conversion from 
clinical node-positive (cN+) to pathologic node-negative (ypN-) status after 
NAC.
RESULTS: Overall, 124 patients (9.3%) had lobular histology, with 69% being 
hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative 
(HR+/HER2-). There was no difference in mastectomy rate (57.2% for lobular vs. 
55.8% for non-lobular). The ILC cohort had more positive margins after 
lumpectomy than the non-ILC cohort (21.2% vs. 7.9%; p = 0.023). Within cN0 
cases, axillary dissection was significantly more common among the lobular cases 
(24.1% vs. 14.0%; p = 0.039). Conversion from cN+ to ypN0 did not differ 
statistically between lobular and non-lobular cases (40.9% vs. 51.2%; p = 0.11). 
The nodal conversion rate among cN+lobular tumors was 30.6% in HR+/HER2-, 72.7% 
in HER2+, and 66.7% in triple-negative cases.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate the challenges of surgical management for 
ILC but hold promise that molecular classification can improve treatment 
selection. While high genomic risk is generally less common among ILC, our 
findings suggest that gene expression assays in cN+ILC patients can identify a 
subset who may benefit from NAC.

BACKGROUND: Echocardiographic metrics of right ventricular (RV) chamber size and 
function enhance prognostication, risk stratification, and measurement of 
therapeutic response in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), 
though the most effective metrics remain unclear.
RESEARCH QUESTION: In a well-phenotyped cohort of patients with incident and 
prevalent PAH, can qualitative grades of RV echocardiographic function be 
established based on their association with functional outcomes, and do they 
demonstrate prognostic value beyond traditional risk scores?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Redefining Pulmonary Hypertension Through 
Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics (PVDOMICS) program, 405 (prevalent, n = 
336; incident, n = 69) participants were investigated. Multivariable linear 
regression examined associations with 6-minute walk distance and the Comparative 
Prospective Registry for Newly Initiated Therapies (COMPERA) and the Registry to 
Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL) Lite 2.0 PAH risk 
scores. Penalized Cox regression was used to develop new models combining prior 
risk score variables with echo parameters. Cluster analysis combined with 
survival analysis adjusting for potential confounders was used to demonstrate 
prognostic significance.
RESULTS: In both incident and prevalent PAH, reduced RV function was associated 
with increased N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, reduced 
6-minute walk distance, and increased COMPERA and REVEAL Lite 2.0 risk scores 
after adjusting for duration of PAH and relevant confounders. The addition of 
echocardiographic variables to models incorporating the COMPERA and REVEAL 2.0 
scores yielded a 10% increase in the C-statistic. The severe RV dysfunction 
group was associated with increased all-cause mortality, with up to a threefold 
increase in mortality in multivariable models adjusted for relevant confounders, 
PAH duration, and invasive pulmonary vascular resistance.
INTERPRETATION: Our results show that reduced RV function on echocardiography in 
PAH is associated with worsened outcomes in incident and prevalent PAH. 
Echocardiographic assessment of RV function provided additional value to 
existing PH risk prediction scores and invasive hemodynamics. Furthermore, 
defining severity of RV function through cluster analysis has important 
implications for risk prognostication, with potential application to monitor 
response to therapy.

BACKGROUND: Valve regurgitation is associated with systemic ventricular 
dysfunction and mortality in patients with Fontan palliation. Valve repair and 
valve replacement with bioprostheses have limited durability, and outcomes after 
valve replacement with mechanical prostheses are poorly defined. The study 
objectives were to assess: (1) Operative mortality, valve-related complications 
(stroke, mechanical valve thrombosis, major bleeding complication, prosthetic 
valve endocarditis, and valve reoperation), and late mortality/transplant. (2) 
Postoperative changes in ventricular volumes and ejection fraction; (3) 
Postoperative changes in the clinical indices of disease severity.
METHOD: Retrospective cohort study of adults (age ≥18 years) with Fontan 
palliation who underwent isolated aortic or atrioventricular valve replacement 
at Mayo Clinic (2003-2023). Preoperative and postoperative evaluations (clinical 
evaluation, echocardiogram, biomarkers) were performed 6 months preoperatively 
and 6-24 months postoperatively, respectively.
RESULTS: Overall, 17 patients underwent isolated atrioventricular (N = 9) or 
aortic valve (N = 8) replacement with mechanical prosthesis (age 27 ± 8 years; 9 
[53 %] males). There was no operative mortality. There was postoperative 
improvement in functional capacity (NYHA class), heart failure indices (NT 
proBNP), and hepatorenal function (MELD-XI score). There was a postoperative 
decrease in systemic ventricular volumes, without change in ejection fraction. 
The 10-year cumulative incidence of valve-related complications and 
death/transplant was 15 % and 18 %, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Atrioventricular valve and aortic valve replacement with mechanical 
prostheses was associated with low (zero) operative mortality, low risk of 
valve-related complications, and clinical improvement. This suggests that valve 
replacement with mechanical prostheses may be an effective palliation in 
selected patients and may delay the need for transplant in this population.

Home-based pulmonary rehabilitation and health coaching in fibrotic interstitial 
lung disease: a perspective on current evidence and future directions.

INTRODUCTION: The fibrotic interstitial lung diseases ;(f-ILD) are often 
progressive and debilitating lung diseases with significant symptom burden and 
impaired quality of life. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) has demonstrated 
improvements in dyspnea, physical function, and respiratory-related quality of 
life (RR-QoL) in patients with -f-ILD but had limited uptake and completion in 
real-world settings.
AREAS COVERED: A literature review was completed on the impact and limitations 
of traditional PR in f-ILD, with additional perspective on the use of home-based 
approaches and implementation of health coaching. Barriers to traditional 
center-based PR programs include patient and systems-based factors such as 
unawareness of benefit, emotional or psychological distress, and limited access. 
Home-based PR may address these limitations by removing travel barriers, 
increasing access with remote supervision and monitoring, and promoting social 
support by connecting care with familiar settings. Studies involving home-based 
PR in ILD have shown promise with improving functional and quality of life 
outcomes and high compliance rates. Health coaching is a collaborative paradigm 
for fostering behavior change and has demonstrated positive impact in the 
management of chronic diseases.
EXPERT OPINION: A combination of health coaching with home-based PR may address 
ongoing challenges of PR uptake and compliance as well as expand PR as a 
holistic and comprehensive intervention.

Electrical storm (ES) is associated with a significant risk of morbidity and 
mortality. Despite this, there has been limited research in ES resulting in 
uncertainty and inconsistency in the management of this life-threatening 
condition. The objective of this scoping review was to define the current body 
of literature evaluating pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies used in 
the management of ES. A comprehensive search of Medline, CENTRAL and Embase was 
completed on January 11, 2025. Primary studies on pharmacotherapies in ES were 
included if they reported therapy-related outcomes and included ≥ 5 adult 
patients. A total of 45 studies met the inclusion criteria. Four studies were 
randomized control trials (three trials had overlapping cohorts) and the 
remaining were observational studies. Amiodarone, quinidine, landiolol, 
isoproterenol, and mexiletine were the most studied medications. The use of 
sedation for ES was exclusively studied in the context of mechanical 
ventilation. There was an increase in the number of ES studies over time, but 
sample sizes remained small and unchanged. Existing evidence to guide the 
management of ES is predominantly based on small observational studies. High 
quality data to inform the management of ES is needed.

Tracking skeletal joint kinematics in vivo with biplane videoradiography (BVR) 
can rigorously address a range of important questions in musculoskeletal 
research. Here we report on SlicerAutoscoperM (SAM), an upgrade of the 
markerless tracking software (Autoscoper) and its migration into the established 
computing environment of 3DSlicer and addition of a comprehensive pre-processing 
module to provide a standardized workflow. We present the accuracy and agreement 
in tracking four skeletal joints by four research groups. Accuracy was assessed 
by comparing marker-generated and SAM kinematics for bones of the foot, knee, 
shoulder, and wrist. Bland-Altman analyses quantified bias (mean error) and 
limits of agreement (LOA). Tracking accuracy was robust for all joints. In the 
foot, mean error (bias) was less than 0.5° (1.8°) and 0.8 mm (3.1 mm). In the 
knee, mean error was less than 1.0° (1.5°) and 0.4 mm (0.8 mm). In the shoulder, 
mean translational error for both the humerus and scapula was less than 0.2 mm 
(0.7 mm). Rotational error was highest in Roll and Pitch for the humerus, 1.9° 
(4.8°) and 1.7° (4.6°), respectively, and Yaw was 0.3° (2.1°). The scapula 
rotational bias was less than 0.2° (0.7°). In the wrist, the error was less than 
0.05° (1.2°) and 0.5 mm (1.2 mm). Our data demonstrate that SAM is an accurate 
image-based skeletal motion tracking tool. With broad adoption, SAM will promote 
collaboration, simplify the harmonization of methods between study sites for 
large multi-center research studies, lower the entry bar for early-stage 
investigators, and facilitate translations toward clinical use.

PRCIS: Combined phaco-ELIOS in ocular hypertension and glaucoma showed a 
statistically significant reduction in the number of hypotensive medications of 
1.5 compared with baseline, with 78.4% of eyes being medication-free at 12 
months.
PURPOSE: To describe the change in medication and intraocular pressure 12 months 
after the combined phacoemulsification-ELIOS procedure.
METHODS: Retrospective, multicenter interventional case series of adults with 
ocular hypertension or glaucoma undergoing phaco-ELIOS. Clinical data were 
collected and analyzed from preoperative baseline up to 12 months 
postoperatively. The primary outcome was the mean change in medication compared 
with baseline. Secondary outcomes were intraocular pressure change from 
baseline, incidence of acute postoperative intraocular pressure elevation, and 
surgical success at 1 year, defined as intraocular pressure reduction of ≥20% 
compared with baseline with no increase in medications, or reduction of ≥1 
medications compared with baseline with intraocular pressure equal or below 
baseline, with no secondary glaucoma surgeries and no loss of light perception.
RESULTS: One hundred twelve eyes were included. Forty-two patients (51.2%) were 
female. Mean (±SD) age was 70.6 (±9.6) years. The most frequent diagnosis was 
primary open angle glaucoma (71.4%). The mean number of medications at baseline 
and 12 months was 1.8 (±0.8) and 0.4 (±0.7), respectively, representing a 
reduction of 1.5 (±1.0) ( P <0.0001). At the end of follow-up, 78.4% of eyes 
were medication-free. Mean intraocular pressure at baseline and 12 months was 
19.9 (±4.0) mm Hg and 16.7 (±2.6) mm Hg, respectively, a significant decrease of 
3.2 mm Hg (±4.0) or 13.7% ( P <0.0001). Surgical success was achieved in 75.9% 
of eyes at 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined phaco-ELIOS in glaucoma significantly reduced medication 
use and IOP, with over 75% of eyes being medication-free at 12 months.

OBJECTIVES: To examine associations between multimorbidity, the social 
determinants of health (SDoHs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) flare and 
remission.
METHODS: All patients aged ≥18 years in Olmsted County, Minnesota, with incident 
RA in 1999-2014 were identified. Using a list of 55 chronic medical conditions, 
multimorbidity was defined as the presence of ≥2 conditions and substantial 
multimorbidity as ≥5 conditions. The Area Deprivation Index and Social 
Vulnerability Index (SVI) were used as proxies for adverse SDoH burden. Flare 
and remission were defined using Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis 
Clinical Trials definitions. Mixed effects models were used to assess 
associations between flare/remission and multimorbidity, adverse SDoH burden and 
other patient characteristics.
RESULTS: This study included 659 patients with incident RA. Multimorbidity and 
substantial multimorbidity predicted 29% (OR:1.29, 95% CI:1.04 to 1.59) and 26% 
(OR:1.26, 95% CI:1.03 to 1.53) higher odds of flare, respectively. Both were 
associated with 34% (OR:0.66, 95% CI:0.49 to 0.90) and 33% (OR:0.67, 95% CI:0.51 
to 0.90) lower odds of remission, respectively. SVI predicted 8% lower odds of 
remission for every 0.1 increase above 0.3 (OR:0.92, 95% CI:0.85 to 0.99). Flare 
was also associated with female sex, smoking, younger age and shorter disease 
duration, but not seropositivity. Remission was also associated with male sex, 
never smoking, older age and longer disease duration, but not seropositivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimorbidity predicts higher odds of RA flare and lower odds of 
remission. Adverse SDoH burden predicts lower odds of remission. These findings 
have the potential to inform disease prognostication and clinician 
interventions.

OBJECTIVE: This QI project aimed to enhance pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) 
staff's ability to recognize and compassionately respond to caregiver fatigue 
(CF), tailoring interventions to the specific needs identified.
METHODS: An interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals developed and 
implemented a comprehensive strategy to improve the recognition and management 
of CF. This QI project included creating educational materials for staff, 
enhancing unit resources, and introducing targeted interventions. Data 
collection involved pre- and post-project surveys.
RESULTS: The program led to significant improvements in PICU staff's confidence 
in recognizing and responding to CF, increased availability of unit resources, 
enhanced staff compassion, and reduced callousness toward others.
CONCLUSIONS: This QI project emphasized the role that structured initiatives and 
interdisciplinary collaboration can play in addressing CF within the PICU 
setting. Improvements in staff confidence, compassion, and reduced burnout 
demonstrate the program's effectiveness. These findings underscore the value of 
targeted interventions and provide a valuable framework for further research and 
can serve as a model for other healthcare units seeking to integrate CF 
management into comprehensive patient care.

B cell lymphomas arise from mutations that disrupt normal germinal center B cell 
programs and promote a microenvironment that fosters aberrant proliferation and 
immune escape. In this issue of Cancer Cell, Hesterberg et al. show that 
lymphoma accelerates T cell aging by transcriptional and epigenetic 
reprogramming that mirrors physiological aging.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) 3B is considered an aggressive lymphoma, however recent 
studies have challenged this paradigm. Additional controversy involves the 
clinical implication of pure FL3B (FL3Bp) vs FL3B with concurrent diffuse large 
B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (FL3Bc). To address these questions, we performed a 
pooled study of the MER and LEO cohorts comparing 464 newly diagnosed, 
R-CHOP-treated patients with FL1-2 (n = 216), FL3A (n = 170), FL3B (n = 78) and 
739 DLBCL. Among FL3B patients, 19 (24%) had FL3Bc and 59 (76%) FL3Bp. Baseline 
characteristics and outcomes were similar between the two FL3B subtypes. 
Compared to FL1-3A, FL3B showed similar clinical features, except for a lower 
tumor burden. After R-CHOP, FL1-2 patients had an inferior event-free survival 
(EFS) than those with FL3B, whereas there was no difference with FL3A. Survival 
was similar across the FL grades. Although FL1-2 patients failed to achieve 
EFS24 more frequently than FL3B and FL3A, FL3B patients who failed EFS24 had 
three-fold higher risk of subsequent mortality than other FLs. At 5-year 
follow-up FL3B patients had twice the risk of relapse with an aggressive subtype 
than those with FL1-2 and FL3A. Compared to DLBCL, FL3B patients had more 
favorable clinical features, but similar outcomes to GCB subtype. Our data 
suggest that most FL3B have a good outcome, while a subset has an aggressive 
behavior.

OBJECTIVE: As the use of poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase 
inhibitors (PARPi) increases in the management of advanced ovarian cancer, 
therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 
may be observed more frequently. Strategies for management of this unique 
condition are needed.
METHODS: In this case report, we demonstrate the case of a patient with advanced 
ovarian cancer and a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation who developed MDS following 
4 years of maintenance PARPi.
RESULTS: Management of therapy-related MDS/AML is variable. In addition, 
subsequent oncologic treatments may be limited due to risk of MDS/AML recurrence 
with exposure to cytotoxic therapies and/or PARPi. Risk for MDS/AML recurrence 
can be monitored and predicted by evaluation for clonal hematopoiesis. This 
patient underwent autologous stem cell transplant. After subsequent disease 
recurrence, she underwent repeat germline testing which showed BRCA1 wildtype. 
In addition, no clonal hematopoietic clones were identified using a specialized 
institutional assay. For this reason and given previous durable response to 
PARPi, the patient was re-treated with a PARPi.
CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the unique management of therapy-related 
MDS/AML and underscores the importance of multidisciplinary care in determining 
safety of subsequent cancer-directed therapies in this patient population.

The oncogenic BRAF(V600E) mutation activates the ERK1/2 pathway and is detected 
in 10% of human colorectal cancers (CRCs) where it is associated with poor 
prognosis. Inhibitors of BRAF have shown only modest efficacy in patients with 
CRC due to intrinsic drug resistance. We studied the CDK2/CDK9 inhibitor, 
fadraciclib, alone and in combination with the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib in 
isogenic human RKO CRC cells with two, one, or no BRAFV600E alleles (RKO+/+, 
A19+/-, T29-/-) and in BRAF wild-type HCT-116 cells, including Bax knockout 
HCT-116Bax-/- cells. Treatment with fadraciclib was shown to suppress MCL-1 and 
phospho-MCL-1 (Ser64), induce a Bax-dependent apoptosis, and inhibit colony 
formation in a BRAF gene dose-dependent manner. Fadraciclib decreased 
phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, indicating suppression of RNA 
transcription. The tumor growth inhibitory effect of fadraciclib plus 
encorafenib was synergistic. Fadraciclib decreased Rb phosphorylation, inhibited 
cell cycle progression, and promoted DNA damage as evidenced by cleavage of 
PARP, increased pH2AX (ser139), and activation of p53. In RKO+/+ versus A19+/- 
or T29-/- cells, drug treatment was associated with greater suppression of p-Rb 
and inhibition of apoptosis and the cell cycle. In a zebrafish xenograft model, 
fadraciclib plus encorafenib significantly reduced tumor size, concurrent with 
increased caspase-3 activation. In human CRCs, BRAF mutation was associated with 
overexpression of CDK2, and CDK9 overexpression was associated with worse 
patient survival. In conclusion, fadraciclib depletes MCL-1 to potentiate 
apoptosis and, combined with encorafenib, synergistically suppresses tumor cell 
growth in a BRAFV600E gene dose-dependent manner. These data suggest a novel 
therapeutic strategy in CRCs with BRAFV600E.

CONTEXT: Defects in insulin secretion and action contribute to the progression 
of prediabetes to diabetes. However, the contribution of α-cell dysfunction to 
this process has been unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to understand the relative contributions of α-cell 
and β-cell dysfunction to declining glucose tolerance.
METHODS: A longitudinal, community-based observational study was conducted at a 
clinical research unit at an academic medical center. We studied 96 individuals 
without diabetes (age 55 ± 1 years; body mass index 27.7 ± 0.4) on 2 occasions, 
3 years apart using an oral 75-g glucose challenge. Indices for insulin 
secretion and action were estimated using the oral minimal model. Glucagon 
secretion rate (GSR) was estimated by deconvolution from peripheral glucagon 
concentrations. Main outcome measures included glucose tolerance status 
(categorical variable) and then symmetrical percentage change in peak and 
120-minute glucose (post oral glucose tolerance test) concentrations (continuous 
variables).
RESULTS: A total of 32 individuals progressed from normal to impaired glucose 
tolerance (IGT) or from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The disposition index (DI) 
declined in the progressors (568 ± 98 vs 403 ± 65 10-4 dL/kg/min per μU/mL, 
baseline vs 3 years; P = .04). α-Cell suppression by glucose (δGSR/δglucose) did 
not change in the nonprogressors (1.5 ± 0.1 vs 1.3 ± 0.1 nmol/min/L; P = .37) 
but decreased (1.0 ± 0.2 vs 0.8 ± 0.2 nmol/min/L; P < .01) in those who 
progressed. Analysis of the entire cohort showed that DI and δGSR/δglucose were 
independently and inversely correlated with an increase in glycemic excursion.
CONCLUSION: These data show that α-cell dysfunction accompanies a decline in 
β-cell function as IGT or overt type 2 diabetes develops.

Gastrointestinal (GI) defects pose a significant clinical challenge, impacting 
patient outcomes and healthcare costs. Endoscopic closure techniques have 
emerged as effective and minimally invasive approaches to manage these defects. 
This review explores the various endoscopic techniques, including over-the-scope 
clips (OTSC), endo suturing systems, through-the-scope (TTS) clips, and the 
X-Tack system. Each technique offers distinct advantages and limitations, making 
it suitable for specific clinical scenarios. While these devices have 
demonstrated promising results in clinical practice, further research is needed 
to optimize their use and address knowledge gaps. Large-scale randomized 
controlled trials are essential to establish evidence-based guidelines for 
device selection and procedural techniques. By embracing technological 
advancements and addressing research limitations, the field of endoscopic 
closure devices has the potential to revolutionize GI care, leading to improved 
patient outcomes and expanded therapeutic possibilities.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Comorbidities such as diabetes, 
chronic cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, liver diseases, and renal 
diseases exacerbate the disease, particularly in older patients, pregnant and 
lactating women.
OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to identify all studies reporting on 
risks associated with these comorbidities to detect the cause of severity of 
COVID-19 in these diseases and further selection of the most suitable treatment 
in each disease.
METHODS: An extensive literature search was performed in the PubMed, Cochrane, 
and Web of Science databases gathering all available articles. We only selected 
case-control studies that met inclusion criteria and that focused on high-risk 
chronic diseased patients, pregnant and lactating women that being infected with 
COVID-19. Selected studies were grouped into 8 broad categories for review and 
analysis: (1) pathophysiology of COVID-19, (2) characteristics of COVID-19, (3) 
common laboratory markers of COVID-19, (4) commonly approved and used treatment 
of COVID-19, and (5) recommended protocol regimen adjustment in comorbid 
diseases, pregnant and lactating women.
CONCLUSION: This review focused on pathophysiology of COVID-19 especially in 
comorbid chronic diseased patients, pregnant and lactating women with the most 
suitable protocol regimen adjustment in each group.

The complementarity and clinical utility of combining liquid biopsies and 
radiomic image analysis has not been demonstrated. ctDNA minimal residual 
disease after chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is 
highly prognostic, but on-treatment biomarkers are needed to enable 
response-adapted therapies. In this study, we analyzed 418 patients with NSCLC 
undergoing CRT to develop and validate a novel dynamic risk model that 
accurately predicts ultimate progression-free survival during treatment. We 
optimize tissue-free variant calling from plasma samples to facilitate ctDNA 
monitoring and demonstrate the importance of accounting for persistent clonal 
hematopoiesis variants. We show that mid-CRT ctDNA concentration is prognostic 
for disease progression and integrate additional pre-CRT risk factors, including 
radiomics, into a combined model that improves outcome prediction. Our results 
suggest that tumor features, radiomics, and mid-CRT ctDNA analysis are 
complementary and can identify patients at high and low risk of progression to 
potentially enable response-adapted therapies.
SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that combining tumor features, radiomics, 
and ctDNA analysis improves outcome prediction in NSCLC treated with CRT 
therapy. Our integrated model could enable personalized and response-adapted 
therapies to reduce toxicity and improve outcomes in patients. See related 
commentary by Anagnostou and Aggarwal, p. 1534.

Background: Increasing maternal body mass index (BMI) represents a risk factor 
for Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and adverse obstetrical and perinatal 
outcomes. Objective: To stratify clinical outcomes for pregnancies affected by 
GDM according to maternal BMI. Methods: Retrospective cohort study including 
individuals ≥18 years of age who were diagnosed with GDM from 2018 to 2022. 
Universal GDM screening was employed with a 50 g oral glucose challenge test ± a 
100 g oral glucose tolerance test. Maternal demographics, preexisting medical 
conditions, and selected obstetric and neonatal morbidities were evaluated. 
Results: A total of 2193 pregnancies in 2110 women affected by GDM were 
identified. This included 506 (23.0%) with normal baseline maternal BMI, 596 
(27.2%) with overweight, and 1091 (49.7%) with obese BMI. Adverse maternal 
outcomes were more frequent in the obese compared to overweight or normal BMI 
categories (cesarean delivery: normal 26.9% vs. overweight 28.5% vs. obese 
40.9%; p < 0.001; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: normal 8.7% vs. 
overweight 12.1% vs. obese 16.8%; p < 0.001). Postpartum glucose intolerance was 
higher in women with obesity (normal 7.3% vs. overweight 5.9% vs. obese 14.9%; p 
< 0.001). Infants born to mothers with obesity had higher birthweights (normal 
3.3 kg vs. overweight 3.4 kg vs. obese 3.5 kg; p < 0.001), were more likely to 
have neonatal hypoglycemia (normal 29.4% vs. overweight 24.3% vs. obese 41.9%; p 
< 0.001) and require intensive care unit admission (normal 8.1% vs. overweight 
5.9% vs. obese 11.9%; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Patients with GDM and baseline 
BMI in the obese range experienced the highest rate of adverse outcomes, while 
those with overweight BMI had similar outcomes to individuals who had normal BMI 
at baseline.

BACKGROUND: The rates of obesity among immigrant populations within the USA rise 
with increasing duration of residency. The aims of this study were to examine 
weight self-perception and body image discrepancy within a large community 
sample of Hispanic and Somali predominantly immigrant adults.
METHODS: Utilizing a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach to 
collect survey data from a sample of adults who self-identified as Hispanic, 
Latino, or Somali in Southeast Minnesota. Correlations among actual body mass 
index (BMI), perceived weight category, and perceived body size were assessed 
with Spearman rank correlation coefficients. Associations of weight loss 
intentions with actual BMI, perceived weight category, perceived body size, and 
body image discrepancy were assessed using Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests.
RESULTS: A total of 1256 adults completed the survey and biometric measurements 
(610 Hispanic, 646 Somali); 81% (457) and 50% (328) had a BMI in the overweight 
or obese category in the Hispanic and Somali cohorts, respectively. Among 
participants with a BMI of > 25, more participants reported a perceived body 
size that was overweight or obese than a perceived weight category that was in 
the overweight or obese category (79% vs. 48%, p =  < 0.0001). Body image 
discrepancy, but not actual BMI, was associated with weight loss intentions for 
both groups. Perceived body size and perceived weight category were associated 
with weight loss intentions for Hispanic participants only.
CONCLUSIONS: Perceived body size is a more accurate self-report proxy of 
BMI-defined weight status compared with the perceived weight category among 
Hispanic and Somali immigrant groups. Body image discrepancy may be more 
predictive of weight loss intentions than actual BMI.

BACKGROUND: Psoriasis is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease primarily 
affecting the skin and joints. Growing evidence suggests an association with 
pulmonary comorbidities, though lung involvement remains under characterized. We 
reviewed the literature and conducted a retrospective analysis to define 
pulmonary manifestations in psoriasis patients, termed Psoriasis-Associated Lung 
Disease (Psoriasis-LD).
METHODS: We identified 251 adult psoriasis patients at our academic center 
(2012-2022) who had chest CT scans and/or pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Data 
included demographics, psoriasis phenotype/treatment, respiratory symptoms, 
PFTs, radiographic features, and outcomes. Psoriasis-LD was defined by symptoms 
and/or CT abnormalities and/or abnormal PFTs. CT findings were categorized as: 
fibrotic (traction bronchiectasis/honeycombing), airway disease (bronchial wall 
thickening/bronchiectasis), or ground-glass opacities (GGO)/consolidation. 
Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, group comparisons, 
Kaplan-Meier, and Cox proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 64.6 ± 14.7 years, with an equal gender 
distribution (50% female). Common comorbidities included obesity, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and sleep apnea. CT abnormalities 
included pulmonary ground-glass opacification or consolidation (25.1%), airway 
disease (8-9%), and interstitial fibrosis (3-7%), with over half of the patients 
displaying any one of these features. Airway disease and GGO were strongly 
linked to death or transplant (HR 2.07, 2.50, respectively). Follow-up showed 
that 39% of patients died or received lung transplants. Interstitial lung 
disease (ILD) was confirmed in 8.8%, mainly NSIP and UIP patterns and most 
patients with ILD had additional risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Pulmonary abnormalities frequently occur in psoriasis patients and 
correlate with poorer outcomes, suggesting that psoriasis may be a significant 
risk factor for pulmonary complications. Earlier detection and multidisciplinary 
management are essential to improving patient outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To conduct a meta-analysis evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of 
computed tomography (CT) for identifying T3-T4 colon cancer using histopathology 
as the reference standard. Secondary objectives included assessing CT's 
performance for detecting extramural vascular invasion (EMVI) and nodal 
involvement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis followed 
PRISMA-DTA guidelines and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library for 
studies published up to September 2024. Eligible studies evaluated CT for 
preoperative T staging (T3 or higher), EMVI, and/or nodal status in primary 
colon cancer, reporting sensitivity and specificity. Studies on rectal cancer, 
using specialized CT techniques, or not in English, were excluded. Pooled 
sensitivity and specificity for T staging, EMVI, and nodal status were 
calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses explored sources of 
heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Thirty-two studies, including 222,948 patients (mean age 69 years; 
50.5% female), were analyzed. For pT3-T4 staging, pooled sensitivity and 
specificity were 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76-0.85) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.66-0.83). For 
pT3c-T4, sensitivity was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.62-0.79) and specificity was 0.83 (95% 
CI: 0.74-0.89). EMVI detection showed sensitivity of 0.40 (95% CI: 0.30-0.52) 
and specificity of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71-0.87). A reliable pooled estimate for 
nodal status could not be determined.
CONCLUSION: CT shows good diagnostic performance for identifying T3-T4 colon 
cancer and can detect high-risk features like EMVI. These findings support its 
role in selecting candidates for neoadjuvant therapies, although EMVI 
sensitivity remains limited.
KEY POINTS: Question How accurate is CT for identifying T3-T4 colon cancer and 
detecting key prognostic factors like EMVI to support neoadjuvant treatment 
planning? Findings CT shows good accuracy for T3-T4 staging (sensitivity 0.81; 
specificity 0.75) and high specificity (0.80) but low sensitivity (0.40) for 
EMVI. Clinical relevance CT enables reliable identification of locally advanced 
colon cancer and high-risk features such as EMVI, supporting better patient 
selection and personalized neoadjuvant treatment planning.

The clinical significance of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) and concomitant 
blood volume expansion (BVE) in chronic left-sided heart failure (HF) is not 
well characterized. Accordingly, we assessed the relationship of RVD severity to 
quantitative measures of blood volume (BV) on clinical outcomes. BV was measured 
in 150 clinically euvolemic patients at hospital discharge using nuclear 
medicine indicator-dilution methodology. Patients were stratified by severity of 
RVD and BVE ≥+25% of normal volume. Data were analyzed for the association of 
RVD and BVE to composite outcome (HF-related mortality/1st rehospitalization) at 
1-year postindex hospitalization. Absolute BV was larger in patients with ≥ 
moderate RVD (n = 80) compared with normal right ventricle (RV) function (n = 
36) (6.8 ± 1.6 vs. 6.1 ± 1.5 L, P = 0.029). Distribution of BV profiles within 
the two subgroups, however, varied significantly. BVE was demonstrated in 59% of 
patients with RVD [compared to 33% with normal RV (P = 0.010)] and normal BV in 
25% with RVD {compared to 44% with normal RV (0.042)]. Kaplan-Meier and Cox 
regression analyses support BVE with erythrocythemia (relative to normal) as an 
independent predictors of better composite outcomes (P = 0.037), whereas RVD was 
not associated with an additional increase in risk (P = 0.137). This prospective 
analysis demonstrated a high prevalence of RVD (76% of cohort) and BVE (51%) at 
hospital discharge. Importantly, BVE with erythrocythemia was associated with 
better composite outcomes despite a high prevalence of RVD, whereas RVD alone 
was not a predictor of further risk. This suggests that BVE may serve as an 
adaptive response in part compensating RVD in chronic left-sided HF.NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY This analysis provides a novel assessment of the relationship between 
the severity of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) and blood volume expansion 
(BVE) on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic left-sided heart failure. 
Findings demonstrate that despite the high prevalence of moderate or greater 
RVD, persistent BVE was associated with better 1-year event-free survival 
relative to normal BV. Hypothesis-generating, this suggests that BVE may provide 
an adaptive response compensating in part for the impact of RVD in chronic HF.

Commutability assessment of a certified reference material (CRM) intended for 
use as a secondary calibrator should be performed by the CRM producer at the 
time the material is originally prepared. Assessment typically includes several 
in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) measurement procedures (MPs) in common use in medical 
laboratories. Due to logistical constraints, it is usually not possible to 
include all existing IVD-MPs in a commutability assessment. In addition, a new 
IVD-MP (IVD-MPn) may be introduced into the market after a commutability 
assessment was performed for a given CRM. Here we provide a recommendation how 
to assess commutability of an existing CRM for use with an IVD-MPn that was not 
included in the original commutability assessment. The study design follows the 
same principles as a full commutability assessment, but it includes only the 
IVD-MPn and fewer additional comparator MP(s) for which the CRM's commutability 
with clinical samples was previously demonstrated. When no reference measurement 
procedure (RMP) is available, or when the logistics make an RMP difficult to 
use, other IVD-MP(s) that were part of the original commutability assessment for 
the CRM should be used as comparator MP(s). When selecting a comparator IVD-MP, 
its performance must be carefully considered and its selectivity for the 
measurand should be equivalent to that of the IVD-MPn. The CRM should have had 
negligible noncommutability bias with the comparator IVD-MP in the original 
commutability assessment. When the existing CRM meets the commutability 
criterion for IVD-MPn, the CRM can be used in the calibration hierarchy of the 
IVD-MPn.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for mechanical 
complications following complex spinal reconstruction for spondylectomy of 
primary spinal column tumors.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review identified patients treated with 
spondylectomy for primary spinal column tumors in the thoracic or lumbar spine 
followed by posterior instrumentation and anterior column reconstruction. 
Variables collected included basic demographics, smoking status, chronic steroid 
use, frailty (Charlson Comorbidity Index), extent of resection, 
Weinstein-Boriani-Biagini classification, tumor volume, Spine Instability 
Neoplastic Score, anterior column reconstruction and fixation techniques, rod 
characteristics, Hounsfield units (HUs), and neoadjuvant/adjuvant 
chemoradiation.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included (14 men, 11 women) with an average 
(± SD) age of 45 ± 18 years, BMI of 28 ± 5.7, and follow-up of 6.0 ± 6.2 years. 
Primary spinal column tumor pathology included chordoma (40%), chondrosarcoma 
(16%), giant cell tumor (16%), osteosarcoma (16%), osteoblastoma (8%), and 
aneurysmal bone cyst (4%). Six patients (24%) experienced mechanical 
complications, including rod fractures (n = 5) and distal junctional failure (n 
= 1). Of the 6 patients with mechanical complications, 4 (67%) underwent 
reoperation. The length of follow-up was the only statistically significant risk 
factor for patients with mechanical complications (average 11 years) compared to 
those without complications (average 4.4 years, p = 0.047). Average HUs were 144 
for mechanical complication patients versus 180 for those without (p = 0.08). 
Anterior column reconstruction materials included a titanium cage (13 patients, 
3 failures), structural allograft (6 patients, 2 failures), vascularized fibular 
strut autograft (6 patients, no failures), nonvascularized structural autograft 
(5 patients, 1 failure), vascularized rib autograft (5 patients, 2 failures), 
and a polyetheretherketone cage (2 patients, no failures). The vascularized 
fibular strut autograft had a 0% mechanical failure rate, but this did not reach 
statistical significance (p = 0.28). Twelve patients (48%) had anterior fixation 
placed, with a 17% rate of mechanical complications (p = 0.65). Five patients 
(20%) had > 2-rod constructs, with a 20% mechanical complication rate (p = 
0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction following primary spinal column tumor resection is a 
significant challenge, as evident by a high rate of mechanical complications and 
instrumentation failure. Future studies are needed with larger sample sizes to 
identify techniques that may mitigate the risk of failure.

Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumors (DLGNTs) are rare, and optimal 
treatment remains undefined. We aim to comprehensively characterize their 
clinical and molecular features, offering granular insights into presentations 
and therapies to elucidate prognostic factors and therapeutic targets. 
Histologic, molecular, and clinical data of 30 patients with DLGNT were 
analyzed. Median age at diagnosis was 7.5 years (range: 0.9-20 years). Disease 
was localized at diagnosis in 16 patients (53.3%), predominantly in the spinal 
cord (14/16, 87.5%). KIAA1549::BRAF fusion occurred in 27 (96.4%) of 28 
patients. DNA methylation profiling of 23 tumors classified 4 (17.4%) as DLGNT 
MC-1, 3 (13.0%) as DLGNT MC-2, and 16 (69.6%) as DLGNT, but not to a specific 
subclass. Median follow-up was 57.5 months. Most patients (90.0%) received 
adjuvant therapy. Chemotherapy was the first-line adjuvant therapy in 19 
patients (70.4%); targeted therapy in 5 patients (18.5%), and radiotherapy in 2 
patients (7.4%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) after first 
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiotherapy was 44 (1-77) months, 18 (4-39) 
months, and 16.5 (9-23) months, respectively. Five-year PFS was 15.9% ± 8.0, and 
5 year overall survival (OS) was 83.3% ± 8.8. Patients older than 9 years at 
diagnosis (p = 0.002) and those with MC-2 (p = 0.04) had worse 5 year OS. 
Multi-omic analysis revealed simultaneous activation of multiple signaling 
pathways, which may serve as potential therapeutic targets. DLGNT remains 
challenging to treat, with poor outcomes across modalities. Further 
investigation of treatment, including targeted therapies addressing activated 
pathways, is needed to improve patient survival.

BACKGROUND: American football has traditionally been male-dominated, but female 
participation in youth football is increasing, especially with the rise of flag 
football. This study aimed to (1) describe the epidemiology of injured body 
parts and diagnoses in female youth football athletes, and (2) compare injury 
patterns between pre-high school (≤14 years) and high school (≥15 years) 
players.
METHODS: American football-related injury data were obtained from the National 
Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) from 2012-2021, representing U.S. 
emergency department visits. All participants were female and ≤18 years. 
Injuries were classified by body part and diagnosis, then compared between 
pre-high school and high school groups. Descriptive statistics summarized injury 
characteristics. Chi-square tests assessed group differences, with odds ratios 
(OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and p-values for significance. NEISS data 
lack detail on injury context, which may limit interpretation.
RESULTS: A total of 3,348 injuries were identified: 2,342 in pre-high school and 
1,006 in high school athletes. The most common injury sites for both groups were 
the upper extremity (pre-high school: 57.9%; high school: 43.1%), followed by 
the lower extremity (22.1% vs. 30.6%) and head/trunk (18.7% vs. 25.1%). Pre-high 
school athletes sustained proportionally more finger injuries (38.8% vs. 27.1%, 
p=0.001) and fractures (31.8% vs. 20.4%, p=0.001). High school athletes had 
higher proportions of head (20.5% vs. 14.1%), ankle (12.7% vs. 10.2%), and knee 
injuries (10.3% vs. 5.3%) (all p<0.05), as well as more sprains/strains (39.3% 
vs. 33.9%, p=0.003) and concussions (11.1% vs. 7.4%, p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Injury patterns differ by age among female youth football players. 
Pre-high school athletes more often sustain finger injuries and fractures, while 
high school athletes experience more head, ankle, and knee injuries, along with 
higher rates of sprains/strains and concussions. These differences may reflect 
variations in physiology and style of play, and findings may inform age-specific 
injury prevention strategies and guide future research on female football 
athletes.

OBJECTIVES: American football continues to be a popular and rapidly growing 
sport among both males and females, with relatively little research concerning 
injuries for the latter - especially in the youth population. The current study 
aims to evaluate the differences in the epidemiology of injured body parts and 
injury diagnoses between youth male and female American football players.
METHODS: Injury data for male and female American football players were 
collected over a 10- year period from the National Electronic Injury 
Surveillance System (NEISS) and retrospectively reviewed. Patients between ages 
4 and 18 years with a medical injury/condition related to American football were 
included. Descriptive analyses were performed for all data including injured 
body parts, injury diagnoses and setting, demographics, and medical disposition. 
Odds ratio (OR), 95% CI, and p-values (p < 0.05) were used for the statistical 
significance between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 82,174 American football injuries were found in the NEISS 
dataset, 95.0% of which were male with a mean age of 13.0 ± 2.9 years. The most 
injured body parts were the head (17.7%), finger (13.8%), knee (9.2%), shoulder 
(8.7%), and ankle (8.0%). The most prevalent injury diagnoses were fractures 
(24.5%), sprains/strains (22.7%), contusions/bruises (12.2%), concussions 
(9.8%), and internal injuries (7.1%). Males were more likely to suffer head 
(OR = 1.32, p < 0.001), knee (OR = 1.23, p < 0.001) and shoulder (OR = 2.19, 
p < 0.001) injuries and females suffered more finger (OR = 3.22, p < 0.001) and 
ankle (OR = 1.25, p < 0.001) injuries. Males were more likely to suffer 
concussions (OR = 1.50, p < 0.001) whereas females sustained more 
sprains/strains (OR = 1.32, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Youth male American football players had a greater likelihood of 
sustaining concussions and head, knee, and shoulder injuries, whereas females 
were more likely to have sprains/strains, finger, and ankle injuries. Future 
studies are warranted to further explore how these differences may be attributed 
to play style and sex-based physiologic and development differences.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CSF-venous fistulas (CVFs) are abnormal connections 
between the subarachnoid space and a paraspinal vein. Transvenous Onyx 
embolization is a recently adopted treatment method for CVF closure, however no 
studies have specifically evaluated for Onyx migration into the CSF. The purpose 
of our study was to evaluate patients who underwent transvenous CVF embolization 
for Onyx migration into the CSF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 100 patients who underwent transvenous CVF 
embolization with posttreatment CT of the spine. Images were reviewed for Onyx 
migration into the CSF at the level of the embolization as well as distally in 
the lumbar spine. Basic demographic information including age and sex were 
recorded.
RESULTS: The mean age was 59.2 years (±10.9, 28-88). Sixty-eight patients were 
women. Forty-eight patients had postembolization imaging of the treated level, 
and none had Onyx migration into the CSF at the level of the CVF. Thirty-four 
patients had imaging of the lumbar spine, and none had Onyx migration distally 
in the lumbar spine.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study did not find any cases of unintended Onyx migration into 
the subarachnoid space in patients who underwent transvenous CVF embolization. 
This speaks to the safety profile of transvenous CVF embolization and suggests 
possible one-way physiology of CVF that allows for egress from the CSF to the 
veins only.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
generally experience poor outcomes despite current therapies; alternative 
treatments are needed. ADP-A2AFP is an investigational autologous T-cell therapy 
with an affinity-enhanced T-cell receptor (TCR) targeting alpha-fetoprotein 
(AFP).
METHODS: We describe a phase I, open-label, first-in-human clinical trial of 
ADP-A2AFP (NCT03132792) in human leukocyte antigen-eligible participants with 
AFP-expressing HCC (or other tumor) not amenable to transplant/resection that 
progressed on, were intolerant to, or refused prior systemic therapy. 
Participants received lymphodepletion chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide 500 
mg/m2/day for 3 days and fludarabine 20 mg/m2/day for 3 days, or 
cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2/day for 3 days and fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for 4 
days) followed by ADP-A2AFP intravenous infusion. Safety evaluation was the 
primary objective; response per RECIST v1.1 was the key secondary endpoint.
RESULTS: Twenty-one participants, 20 with advanced HCC and 1 with gastric 
hepatoid carcinoma received ≥1 ADP-A2AFP infusion. All participants experienced 
≥1 grade 3 or higher adverse event; 52.4% experienced ≥1 grade 3 or higher event 
considered related to ADP-A2AFP treatment. Six participants experienced cytokine 
release syndrome (grade 1-2: n = 5; grade 4: n = 1). Best overall responses were 
complete response (n = 1), partial response (n = 1), and stable disease (n = 
12); overall response rate was 9.5%. Eight patients had duration of stable 
disease ≥16 weeks. Infiltration of ADP-A2AFP TCR and CD8+ T cells was seen in 
AFP-positive areas of post-treatment tumor samples. A relationship was 
demonstrated between increased ADP-A2AFP dose and serum AFP reduction in 
responders.
CONCLUSIONS: Lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by ADP-A2AFP TCR T-cell 
therapy showed a manageable safety profile and preliminary indications of 
antitumor activity in these previously treated patients.
IMPACT & IMPLICATIONS: Adoptive T-cell therapy could be a much-needed additional 
treatment strategy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Clinicians and 
researchers interested in the development of adoptive T-cell therapies for 
advanced solid tumors will be interested to learn that in this phase I trial, 
ADP-A2AFP T-cell receptor T-cell therapy was associated with an acceptable 
benefit-to-risk profile and encouraging antitumor activity, illustrating the 
treatment potential of adoptive T-cell therapy for advanced hepatocellular 
carcinoma.

OBJECTIVES: To summarise the efficacy and safety of 2 years of 
anti-interleukin-5/receptor (anti-IL-5/R) therapy in patients with eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA).
METHODS: Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive benralizumab or mepolizumab 
every 4 weeks during the 52-week double-blind period of the MANDARA trial. 
Patients entered an open-label extension (OLE) in which they continued 
benralizumab (benralizumab/benralizumab) or switched from mepolizumab to 
benralizumab (mepolizumab/benralizumab). Remission (Birmingham Vasculitis 
Activity Score = 0 and oral glucocorticoid [OGC] dose ≤4 mg/d), OGC use, 
relapse, blood eosinophil count (bEOS), and safety up to year 2 (week 104) were 
reported.
RESULTS: A total of 128 patients entered the OLE period (n = 66 
benralizumab/benralizumab; n = 62 mepolizumab/benralizumab). At week 104, 41 
(62.1%) benralizumab/benralizumab patients and 42 (67.7%) 
mepolizumab/benralizumab patients were in remission. During OLE year 1, 51 
(77.3%) benralizumab/benralizumab patients and 42 (67.7%) 
mepolizumab/benralizumab patients had no relapses. By weeks 49 to 52, 27 (40.9%) 
benralizumab/benralizumab patients and 16 (25.8%) mepolizumab/benralizumab 
patients had withdrawn from OGCs, increasing to 29 (43.9%) and 27 (43.5%) at 
weeks 101 to 104, respectively; the median cumulative OGC dose was 950 mg and 
791 mg during OLE year 1, respectively. The median bEOS among 
benralizumab/benralizumab-treated patients was 20 cells/µL (at weeks 52 and 
100), and in mepolizumab/benralizumab-treated patients, it decreased from 70 
cells/µL to 20 cells/µL 4 weeks after switching. Adverse events/serious adverse 
events were reported in 97.0%/22.7% of benralizumab/benralizumab and 100%/35.5% 
of mepolizumab/benralizumab patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with EGPA, treatment for 2 years with anti-IL-5/R 
therapies is associated with durable rates of remission, discontinuation of 
OGCs, bEOS depletion, and low relapse rates. Switching from mepolizumab to 
benralizumab enhances bEOS depletion and OGC sparing.

BACKGROUND: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) requires time-sensitive fibrinolytic 
therapy measured by door-to-needle (DTN) time. Emergency medicine pharmacists 
(EMPs) are integral in emergency departments (EDs) for optimizing AIS care as 
they possess expertise in drug therapy and emergency response.
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis (SR/MA) is to 
evaluate EMP impact on DTN time.
METHODS: This SR/MA searched multiple databases. Eligibility criteria included 
adult ED patients with AIS receiving fibrinolytics with defined EMP involvement. 
The primary endpoint was fibrinolytic DTN time. Secondary endpoints included 
achievement of timely fibrinolytic and length of stay (LOS). Meta-analysis was 
conducted using random-effects models.
RESULTS: Of 494 total citations identified, 214 citations met screening criteria 
with 22 studies undergoing full text review and 9 observational, retrospective, 
cohort studies included. A total of 1064 patients were included for MA with 441 
(41.4 %) in the EMP present group and 623 (58.6 %) in the EMP absent group. EMP 
presence was associated with reduced mean DTN time by 14.6 min (95 % CI -18.1, 
-11.1 min). Odds of achieving a DTN within 60- and 45-min was higher with EMP 
presence, OR 2.85 (95 % CI 1.40, 5.79) and 2.75 (95 % CI 1.99, 3.79), 
respectively. ICU LOS was longer by 2.07 days in the EMP present group, but 
hospital LOS was not different between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: EMP presence during AIS management is associated with a reduction 
in fibrinolytic DTN time compared to no EMP presence. These findings highlight 
the importance of EMPs in optimizing patient outcomes related to stroke care.

This study investigated the effectiveness of portal interventions on refractory 
chylous ascites or chylothorax related to portal hypertension. After 
institutional review board approval, a single-center retrospective review 
identified 10 patients from 2011 to 2023 who underwent portal interventions (8 
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt creation and 2 portal vein 
recanalization) for documented chylous ascites (n = 8) or chylothorax (n = 2). 
Procedural details, clinical data, and chylous fluid volumes were recorded. 
Descriptive statistics and paired t-testing were used. Technical success was 
100% with a median reduction of portal pressure gradient by 7.5 mm Hg. In 5 
patients (50%), the chylous ascites or chylothorax resolved within 30 days of 
the intervention. All patients (n = 10) had decreased weekly fluid volume 
production after intervention (64% mean reduction, P < .001). Median time to 
last paracentesis or thoracentesis was 54 days. No moderate or severe adverse 
events occurred. In the setting of refractory chylous ascites or chylothorax 
associated with portal hypertension, decompressive portal interventions are safe 
and clinically effective.

Racial inequities in postpartum weight have been documented with limited studies 
on the influences of racism and other forms of discrimination. In a prospective 
longitudinal study applying ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and ambulatory 
assessment of weight, we measured the association between discrimination, 
stress, and postpartum weight change. The Postpartum Mothers Mobile Study is a 
cohort of 313 pregnant and birthing individuals who were followed during their 
second and third trimesters through 1 year postpartum. They were recruited in 
clinical settings between 2017 and 2020 in a major city center in Pennsylvania. 
Measures of racism and gender-based discrimination were collected via random EMA 
surveys throughout pregnancy and postpartum, and weight was collected via 
Bluetooth-enabled scales at least weekly. Among Black participants, a 10% 
increase in the number of days a participant experienced racial discrimination 
in the past month was associated with retaining 0.3 more pounds, a 10% increase 
in EMA gender discrimination was associated with retaining 0.4 more pounds, and 
EMA stress reported in the past month was associated with decreased weight 
retention. Chronic experiences of racial and gender discrimination may 
contribute to weight retention immediately after pregnancy and beyond.

BACKGROUND: Low vitamin D concentrations are common-especially among those with 
darker pigmented skin-and are frequently observed during pregnancy. Given its 
important role in brain development, inadequate gestational vitamin D may impair 
child cognitive development.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate associations of gestational vitamin D 
concentrations with childhood cognitive scores, explore whether this 
relationship differs by self-reported race, and examine sensitive exposure 
windows within pregnancy.
METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 912 mother-child dyads (37.3% 
Black, 52.3% White) from the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes 
program. 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations were measured in prenatal 
or cord blood collected between 4 and 42 wk gestation (median: 23 wk). 
Children's cognition was assessed at ages 7-12 y using the NIH Toolbox Cognition 
Battery. Relationships of 25(OH)D and cognitive scores were examined using 
mixed-effects linear models adjusted for confounders. Potential sensitive 
periods were explored by estimating population 25(OH)D patterns across gestation 
for varying levels of the cognitive outcomes.
RESULTS: Mean gestational 25(OH)D was 23.8 ng/mL (SD: 10.0 ng/mL). Each 10-ng/mL 
increase was associated with greater overall (β: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.08, 2.14) and 
fluid cognition scores (β: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.07, 2.34), but not crystallized 
cognition. Although these associations were not significantly modified by 
self-reported race, associations appeared stronger in children of Black mothers 
(β: 2.99; 95% CI: 0.82, 5.16) than those in non-Black mothers (β: 0.43; 95% CI: 
-0.93, 1.78) for fluid cognition. Early pregnancy may be a critical exposure 
period, evidenced by the greatest divergence in the pattern of 25(OH)D during 
this period between the mothers of children in the 90th and those in the 10th 
percentiles of cognitive outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Gestational 25(OH)D concentrations were positively associated with 
cognitive scores, especially in children of Black mothers. Given higher 
deficiency risk among Black women, vitamin D repletion before or in early 
pregnancy may be an important strategy for reducing racial disparities in child 
neurodevelopment.

OBJECTIVE: Vacuoles E1 enzyme X-linked autoinflammatory somatic syndrome (VEXAS) 
is a recently identified rare genetic disorder associated with somatic mutations 
in the UBA1 gene. VEXAS presents with a combination of inflammatory and 
hematologic manifestations, leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: Given the variability in disease presentation and the limited number of 
studies to date, no clinical documents currently exist to provide guidance to 
health care providers about the management of VEXAS. To address this gap, we 
formed an international multidisciplinary panel of VEXAS experts.
RESULTS: Through formalized meetings and a voting process, the group developed 
consensus clinical guidance considerations for the management of VEXAS. These 
considerations offer practical advice on several key topics: (1) clinical 
features of VEXAS, (2) UBA1 screening methods, (3) the diagnosis of 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) in patients with VEXAS, and (4) prognosis and 
management. The aim is to provide expert guidance on which patients to test, how 
to test for VEXAS, how to approach MDS in the context of VEXAS, and 
considerations for management.
CONCLUSION: This work marks the first formal international consensus guidance 
for VEXAS and is intended to be used as a resource for clinicians seeking to 
understand the disease and its management.

Reconstructive surgery, including tendon transfers, can potentially offer marked 
improvement in function in those with cervical spinal cord injuries. Given the 
anatomic redundancy of both the extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) and brevis 
(ECRB) in producing active wrist extension, one muscle can be utilized as a 
donor for a tendon transfer without sacrificing wrist extension. Needle 
electromyography (EMG) does not routinely evaluate the ECRL and ECRB, and the 
functional status of each muscle is difficult to discern based on clinical exam 
alone. Here is presented a case of a 20-year-old male with C6 complete 
tetraplegia and preserved active wrist extension who underwent a novel 
ultrasound (US) -guided EMG technique to accurately and reproducibly assess the 
ECRB and ECRL muscles. This technique was employed to aid his surgeon in 
determining candidacy for tendon transfer procedures utilizing the wrist 
extensors as donors. US-guided EMG showed intact volitional activation in both 
the ECRL and ECRB. Subsequent ECRL to flexor digitorum profundus tendon transfer 
was pursued, and he had preserved postoperative anti-gravity wrist extension 
strength through ECRB alone. Accurate assessment of the ECRL and ECRB allows for 
more complete preoperative planning and provides critical information on whether 
active pinch and grasp reconstruction as possible.

BACKGROUND: Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is one of the most common causes of 
cardiovascular mortality in the United States. Significant variations in the 
management of various cardiovascular conditions have previously been reported, 
but this has been poorly elucidated for pulmonary embolism.
METHODS: During 2016-2020, adult (≥ 18 years) nonelective admissions with PE, 
admitted to Northeast, Midwest, South, and West geographic regions were 
identified using the National Inpatient Sample. Outcomes of interest included 
in-hospital mortality, utilization of PE therapies, non-cardiac organ support, 
total hospitalization costs, and hospitalization duration.
RESULTS: In this 5-year duration, 904,260 admissions were identified - 
Northeast, Midwest, South, and West had 166,050 (18.3%), 225,680 (24.9%), 
350,160 (38.7%), and 162,370 (17.9%) admissions, respectively. On average, 
admissions to the Northeast were less comorbid, from a higher socioeconomic 
status, privately insured, and more commonly admitted to urban teaching and 
medium-sized hospitals (all p < 0.001). The Northeast region also had the lowest 
rates of definitive PE therapies except surgical thrombectomy. In comparison to 
the Northeast, the in-hospital mortality was higher in the South and West and 
lower in the Midwest region (3.1% vs 2.8% vs 3.2% vs 3.3%, p < 0.001). However, 
on adjusted analysis with Northeast as a reference, in-hospital mortality was 
noted to be lower in the Midwest (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.98, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 0.67-0.84; p < 0.001), South (aOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; p < 
0.05), and the West (aOR 0.88, 95% CI 0.78-0.99; p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: In this study, we noted significant heterogeneity in the management 
and outcome of pulmonary embolism across various regions of the United States.

INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Specialty palliative care (SPC) aims to optimize quality of 
life for people with life-limiting illnesses. Previous studies support benefits 
of SPC for people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (pALS) and their 
caregivers; however, few studies have compared patient and caregiver experiences 
with ALS care and SPC.
METHODS: An online survey assessing satisfaction with care was distributed to 
pALS and caregivers who had received SPC. Those who completed the survey were 
also invited to participate in a semi-structured interview.
RESULTS: Thirty-four people (10 pALS, 25 caregivers) from 26 ALS clinics in 20 
states completed the survey. Sixteen also provided a qualitative interview. 
Respondents were most commonly satisfied with their ALS team's ability to answer 
questions (81%), counsel them regarding ALS medications (78%), and manage motor 
symptoms (77%). Respondents were least commonly satisfied with their ALS team's 
ability to manage mood (50%), address spiritual/existential concerns (48%), and 
help them find in-home care providers (38%). SPC was initiated an average of 
14.6 months after ALS diagnosis. Respondents were most commonly satisfied with 
their SPC team's responsiveness to time-sensitive needs between scheduled visits 
(82%) and management of mood (80%) and non-pain physical symptoms (73%). 
Respondents were least commonly satisfied with their SPC team's ability to help 
with equipment needs (52%), make decisions about procedures (50%), and find 
in-home caregivers (46%). Interviews highlighted the emotional support and care 
coordination that SPC teams provide.
DISCUSSION: pALS and caregivers identified distinct and complementary strengths 
of ALS and SPC teams, suggesting that collaboration between teams may provide 
the most comprehensive care.

OBJECTIVES: Within our emergency medical services (EMS) agency, workplace 
violence (WPV) is captured through a documentation feature in the electronic 
medical record. Leveraging this data, we implemented WPV dispatch alerts for 
addresses where physical violence occurred. Our primary objective was to assess 
the association of these alerts on the rate of WPV against EMS clinicians.
METHODS: This observational cohort study took place 11/20/2022-11/20/2024 at a 
hospital-affiliated EMS agency with 23,300 average annual ground calls for 
service. Alerts were implemented on 12/26/2023 and consisted of a notification 
at time of dispatch stating "WPV Flag- Information only: previous documented 
assault at this address." Alerts were updated monthly with a 1-year expiration, 
unless renewed due to repeat physical violence. Rate of WPV in the pre-alert 
period (11/20/2022-12/25/2023) was compared with the post-alert period 
(12/26/2023-11/20/2024) using risk differences (RDs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: A total of 254 (0.78 per 100 EMS calls, 95% CI: 0.69 - 0.89) violent 
incidents (verbal abuse and physical assault) occurred pre-alerts compared to 
153 (0.53 per 100 calls, 95% CI: 0.46 - 0.63) post-alerts (RD= -0.25 cases per 
100 calls, 95% CI: -0.37 to -0.12, p < 0.001). Among these were 96 (0.30 per 100 
calls, 95% CI: 0.24 - 0.36) assaults pre-alerts, compared to 63 (0.22 per 100 
calls, 95% CI: 0.17 - 0.28) post-alerts (RD= -0.07 cases per 100 calls, 95% CI: 
-0.16 to +0.01, p = 0.068). Seventy-seven alerts were placed on identifiable 
addresses; among these, two (2.6%) were renewed due to repeat physical violence 
and 31 (40.3%) were ultimately removed due to no repeat violence in a 12-month 
period. During the post-alert period, EMS clinicians were dispatched a total of 
853 times to addresses with pre-existing alerts (median = 6; range: 1 - 234 
dispatches per address), although this included calls with alerts specific to 
the address but a different unit number from the initial alert (e.g. same 
nursing facility but different resident unit number).
CONCLUSIONS: Providing EMS clinicians with alerts on addresses with previous 
physical violence at time-of-dispatch was associated with a significant decrease 
in the rate of WPV against EMS clinicians overall within our agency.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive and 
chemo-resistant sarcomas with poor survival rates. Loss of CDKN2A or P53 
following NF1 disruption is a key event in MPNST development. Here, we used 
CRISPR-Cas9 somatic tumorigenesis in mice to identify transcriptomic and 
metabolomic features distinguishing CDKN2A- versus P53-deleted MPNSTs. 
Convergent, multiomic analyses revealed that CDKN2A-deleted MPNSTs are 
especially dependent on the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and NADPH metabolism 
for growth and viability. Disruption of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(G6PD), the PPP rate-limiting enzyme, slowed CDKN2A-deleted MPNST growth and 
sensitized MPNSTs to standard-of-care chemotherapy. Knockdown of the 
redox-regulated transcription factor NRF2 slowed MPNST growth and decreased G6PD 
transcription. Analysis of patient MPNSTs identified a NRF2 gene signature 
correlating with tumor transformation. Furthermore, G6PD and NRF2 expression in 
PanCancer TCGA samples correlates with patient survival. This work identifies 
NRF2-PPP dependency as a targetable vulnerability in these difficult-to-treat 
MPNSTs, particularly in the NF1/CDKN2A-deleted majority.

In the largest meta-analysis of international cohorts to date, a family history 
of fracture is confirmed as a significant BMD-independent predictor of future 
fracture risk. Parental and sibling histories of fracture carry the same 
significance for future fracture, including the impact of family hip fracture on 
future hip fracture risk.
PURPOSE: We have undertaken a meta-analysis of international prospective cohorts 
to quantify the relationship between a family history of fracture and future 
fracture incidence.
METHODS: The analysis dataset comprised 350,542 men and women from 42 cohorts in 
29 countries followed for 2.8 million person-years. We investigated the 
relationship between family history of hip fracture or any fracture and the risk 
of any clinical fracture, any osteoporotic fracture, major osteoporotic fracture 
(MOF), and hip fracture alone using an extended Poisson model in each cohort. 
Models were adjusted for current age, sex, BMD, and follow-up time.
RESULTS: As no difference in influence of family history of fracture was seen 
between genders, results are presented for men and women combined. A parental 
history of hip fracture was associated with a higher risk of incident fracture 
across all fracture outcome categories, with a stronger relationship with future 
hip fracture (hazard ratios (HR, 95% CI) for hip and MOF 1.37, 1.23-1.52 and 
1.19, 1.12-1.27, respectively). Associations were slightly reduced but remained 
significant when additionally adjusted for BMD and did not vary by baseline 
offspring age, follow-up time, or parent affected. In a more limited analysis, 
parental history of any fracture or a sibling history of hip or any fracture 
showed similar associations to those observed with parental history of hip 
fracture.
CONCLUSIONS: A family history of fracture is confirmed as a significant 
BMD-independent predictor of future fracture risk. While parental hip fracture 
appears the strongest factor for future hip fracture, a family history of other 
fractures might be appropriate for inclusion in future iterations of the FRAX 
tool.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Most healthcare providers believe that nutrition assessment 
and therapy should be an integral part of patient care. Physicians however 
receive inadequate nutrition education in medical school and postgraduate 
training, resulting in limited interest and poor integration of nutrition into 
clinical practice. The purpose of this paper is to present a means of 
documentation and presentation by registered dietitian nutritionists (RDN) that 
would enhance communication and assimilation of principles in clinical nutrition 
for physicians.
RECENT FINDINGS: In an effort to standardize terminology, promote a uniform 
approach to nutrition care, and gather data for research purposes, the Academy 
of Nutrition and Dietetics (the Academy) developed the Nutrition Care Process 
(NCP). This process with a design and terminology unique to their specialty, 
inadvertently excludes pertinent clinical information from being communicated 
and reduces the impact of the RDN in coordinating the nutrition management of 
their patients. This report introduces a proposal to modify the Academy NCP with 
strategic documentation by which RDNs might better communicate through charting 
and case presentation in a language common to other services and members of the 
healthcare team. Strategic RDN documentation and communication would help 
provide education on the go in the workplace, helping to fill gaps in the 
nutrition knowledge base for physicians. The proposal seeks to further augment 
the role and clinical responsibilities of the RDN on a nutrition consult service 
with the ultimate aim of promoting better patient care.

Growing evidence suggests that the induction of cellular senescence in vascular 
cells is causally linked to the etiology of cardiovascular diseases. To 
investigate systematically the heterogeneity of senescent vascular cells in 
atherosclerosis, we used a high-fat diet and PCSK9 overexpression to induce 
atherosclerosis in a senescence reporter mouse model (p16-tdTomato+/-) and 
performed single-cell RNA sequencing on whole aortas. Using the SenMayo and 
CellAge gene sets, we identified four clusters of vascular smooth muscle cells 
(VSMCs), fibroblasts and T cells enriched in features of senescence, which were 
reduced upon treatment with the senolytic agent ABT-737. We then derived a 
global senescence signature of atherosclerosis including Spp1, Ctsb and 
Tnfrsf11b mRNAs. We validated the enrichment of these mRNAs in senescence by 
using spatial transcriptomics in a second mouse model of atherosclerosis and 
senolysis (Ldlr-/-; p16-3MR), as well as by analyzing in vitro models of human 
VSMC senescence. Our results uncover a vascular-specific transcriptomic 
signature of senescence that may be exploited for tracking and treating 
age-related vascular diseases.

Assisted reproductive technology (ART) for patients with pulmonary disease 
requires multidisciplinary collaboration to optimize patient safety and ART 
outcomes. We present a review of pulmonary pathology, which includes obstructive 
and restrictive lung diseases, vascular lung disease, and mediastinal masses 
which may require alterations in the approach to controlled ovarian 
hyperstimulation or anesthesia at time of oocyte retrieval. Optimization of 
pulmonary function before initiation of ART is of critical importance and 
further highlights the need for interprofessional collaboration.

Multiple myeloma evolution is characterized by the accumulation of genomic 
drivers over time. To unravel this timeline and its impact on clinical outcomes, 
we analyzed 421 whole-genome sequences from 382 patients. Using clock-like 
mutational signatures, we estimated a time lag of two to four decades between 
the initiation of events and diagnosis. We demonstrate that odd-numbered 
chromosome trisomies in patients with hyperdiploidy can be acquired 
simultaneously with other chromosomal gains (for example, 1q gain). We show that 
hyperdiploidy is acquired after immunoglobulin heavy chain translocation when 
both events co-occur. Finally, patients with early 1q gain had adverse outcomes 
similar to those with 1q amplification (>1 extra copy), but fared worse than 
those with late 1q gain. This finding underscores that the 1q gain prognostic 
impact depends more on the timing of acquisition than on the number of copies 
gained. Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the life 
history of myeloma and may have prognostic implications.

Blood-based multicancer early detection (MCED) tests represent a new approach 
for cancer detection. To gain insights into the utility of various approaches of 
evaluating a cancer signal detected (CSD) test result, we evaluated diagnostic 
journeys of a subset of 6,662 participants in PATHFINDER who had a CSD on both 
an initial and refined version of an MCED test that also provided a prediction 
of cancer signal origin (CSO). We sought to determine whether CSO 
prediction-guided diagnostic evaluations led to diagnostic resolution; whether 
participants with known risk factors for cancer beyond age alone and a negative 
initial diagnostic evaluation had a cancer diagnosis during study follow-up; the 
utility of whole-body imaging in reaching diagnostic resolution; and differences 
in the diagnostic journeys needed to reach diagnostic resolution for both true- 
and false-positive results. Of the 39 participants in this analysis, 82% (32/39) 
achieved diagnostic resolution after the initial evaluation, including 78% 
(25/32) who reached resolution specifically with a CSO prediction-directed 
workup. Eighteen percent (7/39) required additional evaluation for persistent 
clinical suspicion of cancer, all of whom achieved resolution (3 with and 4 
without cancer). Whole-body imaging contributed to diagnostic resolution in only 
49% of CSD cases. Approximately 90% of true- and false-positive cases had 
imaging tests; more true positives versus false positives (81.0% vs. 38.9%) had 
nonsurgical and/or surgical procedures. In conclusion, CSO prediction-directed 
evaluations enabled diagnostic resolution for most participants, although some 
with negative initial evaluations but persistent suspicion of cancer required 
additional testing.
PREVENTION RELEVANCE: MCED testing has the potential to increase detection of 
cancer at earlier stages. As MCED testing is a new technology, there are few 
data on the diagnostic journeys patients undergo following testing. We observed 
that for most patients, CSO prediction-directed workups were efficient, leading 
to diagnostic resolution after initial evaluation.

» A thorough understanding of glenoid deformity is essential to anticipate 
intraoperative needs and manage bony deficiencies. Management strategies include 
eccentric reaming, alternate scapular line baseplate orientation, bone grafting, 
or metallic augmentation as either "off-the-shelf" or custom baseplates. 
Accurate implantation of the glenoid component in the presence of glenoid bone 
loss (GBL) may also benefit from shoulderspecific guides, navigation, or robotic 
assistance. » GBL can negatively affect outcomes due to compromised bony 
fixation, altered soft tissue tensioning, and component malposition, which can 
contribute to impingement, dislocation, aseptic loosening, polyethylene wear, 
and component failure. » In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of 
published literature regarding the management of GBL in primary RSA and provide 
additional insight on the effectiveness of current approaches to manage bony 
deficiency.

PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have shown no benefit of 
levothyroxine for subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) in improving well-being, 
cardiovascular outcomes, or mortality. We aimed to evaluate study procedures' 
feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of levothyroxine discontinuation in 
adults with SCH.
METHODS: We conducted a pilot, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT with 6-month 
follow-up at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Adults with SCH on levothyroxine 
≤75 mcg daily were randomized to continue levothyroxine or switch to placebo. 
The primary outcome was feasibility.
RESULTS: Fifty participants were randomized (32% enrollment rate); five were 
excluded post-randomization due to unconfirmed SCH, yielding 45 participants (21 
levothyroxine, 24 placebo). One patient in the placebo group withdrew for 
personal reasons (98% completion rate). Participants' mean age was 68.2 years 
(SD 9.7); 80% were male, and 86.7% were White. At 6 months, there was no 
statistically significant difference between the placebo and levothyroxine 
groups in ThyPRO-Hypothyroid Symptoms [28.3 (22.8) vs. 22.9 (19.5)], Tiredness 
[27.6 (22.8) vs. 32.8 (22.1)], and EQ-5D score [0.750 (0.232) vs. 0.741 
(0.180)]. The only notable adverse event was rib fractures in a placebo group 
participant (TSH 3.04 mIU/L at 6 months). Two participants in the placebo group 
restarted levothyroxine (n = 1, TSH > 10 mIU/L; n = 1, fatigue).
CONCLUSION: We demonstrated feasibility of study procedures for discontinuing 
levothyroxine in patients with SCH and obtained preliminary effects on 
well-being. The low occurrence of adverse events suggests that levothyroxine 
discontinuation may be well-tolerated. These findings support conducting a 
larger multi-site RCT to comprehensively assess the effects of levothyroxine 
discontinuation.

BACKGROUND: Characteristics and outcomes associated with cardiogenic shock (CS) 
with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in older patients have not been well 
characterized.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate characteristics and 
outcomes of older patients admitted with CS with AMI.
METHODS: We used the National Inpatient Sample database to evaluate clinical 
characteristics of hospitalizations, clinical outcomes, and health care 
utilization of hospitalizations of older patients ≥80 years with CS and AMI from 
2003 to 2021. We also compared data from older patients with a reference 
relatively younger patient population (18-79 years).
RESULTS: During the study period, 207,333 hospitalizations of older patients ≥80 
years and 675,491 hospitalizations of patients 18 to 79 years were identified. 
Between the first 4 years of the study period (2003-2006) and the final 4-year 
interval of the study period (2016-2019), there was an increase in the number of 
hospitalizations of older patients with AMI and CS (39,220-51,640). On adjusted 
analysis, there were increases in the percentage of older patients undergoing 
treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention (19.2% to 34.1%; P < 0.001) 
and encounters for palliative care (2.0% to 32.4%; P < 0.001) alongside a 
decline in in-hospital mortality (61.4% to 49.0%; P < 0.001) over the study 
period. Compared to patients 18 to 79 years of age, those aged ≥80 years had 
greater in-hospital mortality (51.8% vs 33.0%; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: From 2003 to 2021, for older patients with CS and AMI, 
hospitalizations increased, and mortality decreased.

BACKGROUND: Carcinomatosis is an advanced form of metastatic cancer, which has 
been thought to be an invariantly fatal disease. We characterized prognostic 
factors for overall survival (OS) in patients with de-novo carcinomatosis.
METHODS: Patients were identified from the SEER database from 
1/1/2016-12/31/2020. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to evaluate 
OS and a Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate adjusted hazard 
ratios (aHR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). We included patients with 
carcinomatosis across 30 primary sites. The most common primary tumors were 
colorectal, pancreas, ovary, and lung & bronchus, and stomach.
RESULTS: Among newly diagnosed cancer patients in SEER, a total of 3131 (59.7 % 
female, 80.1 % White) patients with carcinomatosis were identified, 
corresponding to an incidence of 9.0 per 1000,000 persons. Of all patients with 
metastatic disease, only 0.17 % were diagnosed with carcinomatosis. Compared to 
patients with de novo metastatic disease without carcinomatosis (i.e., those 
with metastases limited to the brain, bone, liver, or lung), patients with 
carcinomatosis were associated with over twice the risk of mortality (aHR = 2.3, 
95 % CI: 2.2-2.5). The 1-year OS for patients with carcinomatosis was 35.8 % 
(95 % CI: 34.0 %-37.7 %). The most common primary sites included: colorectal 
(14.8 %), pancreas (14.8 %), ovary (9.8 %), and lung & bronchus (8.9 %). 
Patients with appendiceal (1-year OS: 88.2 %, 95 % CI: 81.8 %-95.1 %) and 
ovarian (1-year OS: 58.7 %, 95 % CI: 53.0 %-65.0 %) carcinomatosis had markedly 
longer survival compared to patients with carcinomatosis from other primary 
sites. Patients who were at highest risk of death are more likely to be older; 
male; Black; have more advanced T and N categories; and/or have synchronous 
metastases (P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Carcinomatosis is associated with poorer OS compared to other forms 
of metastases. Patients with ovarian and appendiceal tumors have markedly longer 
survival.

PURPOSE: Standardized data collection is needed to improve research for rare 
diseases. In this manuscript, we describe our experience establishing the 
Prospective Ocular Tumor Study (POTS).
METHODS: The ongoing POTS captures all patients with an ocular tumor seen on the 
Ocular Oncology Service at Mayo Clinic Rochester and collects patient 
demographics, tumor features, treatment, and outcomes. This manuscript reports 
data collected from July 2019-July 2024.
RESULTS: During a 5-year time period, 1,766 patients enrolled in the database, 
with 975 (55%) females, 1,732 (98%) white race, and mean age 61.5 years. The 
most frequent tumor types were choroidal melanoma (n = 610 [34%]), choroidal 
nevus (n = 575 [32%]), iris nevus (n = 95 [5.3%]), iris melanoma (n = 46 
[2.6%]), and vitreoretinal lymphoma (n = 46 [2.6%]).
CONCLUSION: The POTS is a valuable source of detailed, longitudinal data on rare 
ocular tumors. Expanding standardized data collection across multiple centers 
will facilitate improved outcomes research in ocular oncology.

INTRODUCTION: Using diagnostic CT for radiotherapy (RT) planning can bypass 
traditional CT simulation but introduces challenges in patient positioning and 
Hounsfield unit (HU) fidelity, affecting dose accuracy. Here a Varian Ethos 
adaptive-driven CT direct-to-treatment (DtT) multi-fraction stereotactic body 
radiation therapy (SBRT) workflow is presented.
METHODS: This study employed institutional diagnostic PET-CT images to generate 
an initial reference Ethos treatment plan. HU and dosimetric accuracy were 
validated for PET-CT, Ethos CBCT images (with and without Hypersight (HS), and 
the gold-standard helical CT simulators). Following the SBRT reference plan 
creation on the low dose diagnostic PET-CT, the first fraction was delivered 
with a newly generated adaptive plan calculated on the HS CBCT (Ethos) images. 
For multi-fraction treatments, the first day CBCT images and adaptive plan 
become the reference for subsequent IGRT treatments. This study includes 
workflow validation and initial three patient experience.
RESULTS: The DtT adaptive SBRT workflow was successfully implemented, with 
initial end-to-end testing demonstrating feasibility. In-house solutions were 
introduced to facilitate the adaptive to IGRT plan conversion. The Ethos system, 
especially with HS, maintained HU fidelity and dose calculation accuracy 
comparable to helical CTs. On-table adaptive sessions were within 37-51 min, 
aligning with single-fraction palliative studies. Subsequent non-adaptive IGRT 
fractions were efficiently completed within 7-27 min.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of DtT adaptive-driven 
multifraction SBRT using diagnostic PET-CT. This approach reduces the need for 
on-site patient presence prior to treatment, expands planning lead times, and 
improves overall efficiency in radiotherapy for well selected patients.

Deep learning techniques hold immense promise for advancing medical image 
analysis, particularly in tasks like image segmentation, where precise 
annotation of regions or volumes of interest within medical images is crucial 
but manually laborious and prone to interobserver and intraobserver biases. As 
such, deep learning approaches could provide automated solutions for such 
applications. However, the potential of these techniques is often undermined by 
challenges in reproducibility and generalizability, which are key barriers to 
their clinical adoption. This paper introduces the RIDGE checklist, a 
comprehensive framework designed to assess the Reproducibility, Integrity, 
Dependability, Generalizability, and Efficiency of deep learning-based medical 
image segmentation models. The RIDGE checklist is not just a tool for evaluation 
but also a guideline for researchers striving to improve the quality and 
transparency of their work. By adhering to the principles outlined in the RIDGE 
checklist, researchers can ensure that their developed segmentation models are 
robust, scientifically valid, and applicable in a clinical setting.

OBJECTIVE: Perineural spread (PNS) of breast carcinoma to the brachial plexus is 
rare. This study investigates the radiologic features supporting the medial and 
lateral pectoral nerves (MPN and LPN, respectively) as pathways for PNS of 
breast cancer to the brachial plexus.
METHODS: We reviewed 19 patients with biopsy-proven PNS of breast carcinoma to 
the brachial plexus. All available MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT studies were 
re-evaluated by a musculoskeletal radiologist with expertise in PNS. Imaging 
features of interest included pectoralis major and minor muscle MRI signal 
abnormality, abnormal FDG activity, and atrophy; FDG avidity within or along the 
course of the pectoral nerves; and extent of brachial plexus involvement on MRI 
and 18F-FDG PET/CT. Demographic and clinical data were also collected.
RESULTS: All 19 patients had MRI and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Six patients showed 
clear radiologic evidence of PNS via the pectoral nerves. All six patients 
demonstrated abnormal MRI signal or enhancement in both the pectoralis major and 
minor muscles and increased FDG uptake was present in the pectoralis major in 
4/6 patients and pectoralis minor in 5/6 patients. Five patients demonstrated 
atrophy of both the pectoralis major and minor muscles. Increased FDG uptake was 
noted along the LPN in five patients and the MPN in four. All exhibited brachial 
plexus enhancement on MRI and increased FDG uptake on PET/CT, supporting 
contiguous spread from the pectoral nerves.
CONCLUSION: This study provides radiologic support for the MPN and LPN as a 
potential pathway for PNS of breast cancer to the brachial plexus. Pectoralis 
major/minor muscle atrophy, abnormal MRI signal or enhancement, and increased 
FDG activity within the pectoral muscles and/or along the pectoral nerves may 
serve as early, non-invasive imaging markers of this process, with potential 
implications for diagnosis and management.

BackgroundBalloon guide catheters (BGCs) are adjunctive devices that may be used 
during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) to induce flow arrest and improve clot 
retrieval and reperfusion outcomes for acute ischemic stroke. As the 
cost-effectiveness of BGC use remains uncertain, this study assessed short- and 
long-term direct healthcare costs associated with BGC use versus standard guide 
catheters (SGC) during MT.MethodsA decision tree model estimated the short-term 
costs (index hospitalization), long-term costs (one year after index 
hospitalization), and total costs for patients undergoing MT + BGC versus 
MT + SGC from a healthcare system perspective in the United States (US), Canada, 
United Kingdom (UK), Sweden, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, and The 
Netherlands. Average device costs were sourced from public tender prices and 
market research data. Weighted average healthcare costs for modified Rankin 
Scale scores were sourced from published literature for the respective 
countries. A 2024 meta-analysis supporting improved outcomes with BGC provided 
input parameters to model treatment effects for BGC and SGC. Deterministic 
one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of model 
parameters and accounted for uncertainty.ResultsAcross all countries, long-term 
and total per-patient costs were lower with MT + BGC, yielding total per-patient 
cost savings of $6297 (US), CAD 3006 (Canada), £1828 (UK), 28,950 kr (Sweden), 
€1077 (Germany), €709 (Italy), €3678 (Spain), €2259 (Belgium), and €3344 (The 
Netherlands). The probability of MT + BGC yielding cost savings ranged 
0.356-0.911 (short term), 0.962-0.975 (long term), and 0.838-0.935 (total 
costs). While long-term and total costs consistently favored MT + BGC, 
short-term cost savings showed more variability across countries.ConclusionThis 
study demonstrates that BGC use is associated with total one-year per-patient 
cost savings for inpatient and postdischarge stroke care across the US, Canada, 
and seven European healthcare systems. Balloon guide catheters can potentially 
reduce post-stroke care costs and should be considered more broadly, despite the 
additional cost incurred by the device.

A bidirectonal relationship between insulin resistance, diabetes and metabolic 
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease exists. In those with metabolic 
syndrome, impairments of glucose and lipid metabolism lead to increased liver 
fat, necroinflammation (steatohepatitis) and subsequent hepatic fibrosis. An 
integrated perspective and heightened awareness of metabolic dysfunction 
associated steatotic liver disease is critical to tempering the rising epidemic 
metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatiitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer and 
need for liver transplanation patients with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. 
Medical and surgical treatments targeting insulin resistance, obesity and 
diabetes mellitus hold promise in improving lipotoxic liver injury which 
contributes to steatohepatitis and progressive hepatic fibrosis.

Enhancing the Characterization of Dural Tears on Photon Counting CT Myelography: 
An Analysis of Reconstruction Techniques.

Photon counting detector CT myelography is an effective modality for the 
localization of spinal CSF leaks. The initial studies describing this technique 
employed a relatively smooth Br56 kernel. However, subsequent studies have 
demonstrated that the use of the sharpest quantitative kernel on photon counting 
CT (Qr89), particularly when denoised with techniques such as quantum iterative 
reconstruction or convolutional neural networks, enhances detection of 
CSF-venous fistulas. In this clinical report, we sought to determine whether the 
Qr89 kernel has utility in patients with dural tears, the other main type of 
spinal CSF leak. We performed a retrospective review of patients with dural 
tears diagnosed on photon counting CT myelography, comparing Br56, Qr89 denoised 
with quantum iterative reconstruction, and Qr89 denoised with a trained 
convolutional neural network. We specifically assessed spatial resolution, noise 
level, and diagnostic confidence in eight such cases, finding that the sharper 
Qr89 kernel outperformed the smoother Br56 kernel. This was particularly true 
when Qr89 was denoised using a convolutional neural network. Furthermore, in two 
cases, the dural tear was only seen on the Qr89 reconstructions and missed on 
the Br56 kernel. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential value of further 
optimizing post-processing techniques for photon counting CT myelography aimed 
at localizing dural tears.ABBREVIATIONS: CNN = convolutional neural network; CVF

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Photon-counting detector CT myelography (PCD-CTM) is a 
recently described technique used for detecting spinal CSF leaks, including 
CSF-venous fistulas. Various image reconstruction techniques, including 
smoother-versus-sharper kernels and virtual monoenergetic images, are available 
with photon-counting CT. Moreover, denoising algorithms have shown promise in 
improving sharp kernel images. No prior studies have compared image quality of 
these different reconstructions on photon-counting CT myelography. Here, we 
sought to compare several image reconstructions using various parameters 
important for the detection of CSF-venous fistulas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all consecutive 
decubitus PCD-CTM between February 1, 2022, and August 1, 2024, at 1 
institution. We included patients whose studies had the following 
reconstructions: Br48-40 keV virtual monoenergetic reconstruction, Br56 
low-energy threshold (T3D), Qr89-T3D denoised with quantum iterative 
reconstruction, and Qr89-T3D denoised with a convolutional neural network 
algorithm. We excluded patients who had extradural CSF on preprocedural imaging 
or a technically unsatisfactory myelogram-. All 4 reconstructions were 
independently reviewed by 2 neuroradiologists. Each reviewer rated spatial 
resolution, noise, the presence of artifacts, image quality, and diagnostic 
confidence (whether positive or negative) on a 1-5 scale. These metrics were 
compared using the Friedman test. Additionally, noise and contrast were 
quantitatively assessed by a third reviewer and compared.
RESULTS: The Qr89 reconstructions demonstrated higher spatial resolution than 
their Br56 or Br48-40keV counterparts. Qr89 with convolutional neural network 
denoising had less noise, better image quality, and improved diagnostic 
confidence compared with Qr89 with quantum iterative reconstruction denoising. 
The Br48-40keV reconstruction had the highest contrast-to-noise ratio 
quantitatively.
CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the sharpest quantitative kernel (Qr89-T3D) with 
convolutional neural network denoising demonstrated the best performance 
regarding spatial resolution, noise level, image quality, and diagnostic 
confidence for detecting or excluding the presence of a CSF-venous fistula.

OBJECTIVE: Intrathecal fluorescein (IF) is effective for localizing nasal 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks along the skull base during endoscopic 
exploration, with largest studies reporting sensitivities ranging from 66%-93%. 
Due to reports of intraoperative and postoperative neurologic complications such 
as seizures and paralysis, surgeons often dilute the fluorescein and inject it 
intrathecally slowly over a variable amount of time. However, no study has 
assessed whether rapid IF administration causes the aforementioned risks or 
whether it affects its accuracy in identifying CSF leaks intraoperatively.
METHODS: A prospective study was conducted from 2015 to 2024, where all patients 
undergoing endoscopic exploration and/or repair of CSF rhinorrhea had 0.1 mL of 
10% fluorescein (10 mg) mixed with 3-5 mL of patients' CSF injected rapidly via 
the lumbar drain over a few seconds.
RESULTS: Of the 82 included patients, the mean age was 53.8 ± 15.2 years, and 
84% were female. Sixty-nine patients underwent successful endoscopic CSF leak 
repairs, and 13 had negative endoscopic explorations. Rapid IF injection was 80% 
sensitive (20% false negative rate) and 100% specific for identifying CSF leaks, 
and it caused no seizures, paralysis, or other neurologic complications.
CONCLUSION: Compared to prior reports of slow low-dose IF injection for CSF leak 
localization, rapid IF injection yielded similar efficacy (80% sensitivity) with 
no IF-related complications. Rapid IF injection was safe and effective but 
should be corroborated by future studies.

Nasal reconstruction presents the facial plastic surgeon with a complex problem 
given its functional and aesthetic importance. The dorsal nasal flap is a 
composite rotational flap of the glabella and nasal dorsum that can be used for 
nasal dorsum and tip defects of medium to large sizes. Given its composite 
nature, this flap can be split into its constituent parts-the epidermis and 
dermis and the subcutaneous tissue and superficial musculoaponeurotic 
system-without flap loss. This case series describes this technique and various 
potential applications within nasal reconstruction.

Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy secondary to amyloid 
fibril deposition in the myocardium. The two precursor proteins that most 
frequently infiltrate the heart resulting in cardiac amyloidosis are 
immunoglobulin light chains (AL) and transthyretin (ATTR). Regardless of the 
type of amyloidosis, cardiac involvement portends a worse prognosis, and those 
patients with symptoms of advanced heart failure should be referred to a heart 
failure specialist for further evaluation and management. Given the lack of 
formalized guidelines for heart transplantation in CA, we propose 
recommendations for the pretransplant evaluation and posttransplant management 
within the context of the best current evidence in addition to expert opinion.

Establishing Clinically Distinct Patient Treatment Subgroups Following Anterior 
Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Machine Learning Clustering Analysis.

BACKGROUND: Treatment decisions in patients with anterior cruciate ligament 
(ACL) injuries are influenced by multiple factors, such as the desire to return 
to sports or symptomatic instability. Identifying the differential treatment 
effect of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) compared with nonoperative management on a 
patient-specific level can inform surgical decision-making.
HYPOTHESIS: Unsupervised machine learning can identify distinct patient 
subgroups based on outcome achievement after ACL injury, and ACLR will exert a 
protective effect on the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) over 
nonoperative management.
STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.
METHODS: A longitudinal populational registry identified patients with ACL 
injuries from 1990 to 2016 with a minimum 7.5-year follow-up. An unsupervised 
random forest algorithm was utilized to develop and validate patient subgroups. 
Treatment effects of ACLR on outcomes were analyzed using a machine learning 
causal inference estimator. Patient subgroup membership was incorporated into a 
multivariable logistic regression to identify factors predictive of optimal 
outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 923 patients (785 primary ACLR, 138 nonoperative) were 
included. The random forest algorithm arrived at an optimal partition of 2 
subgroups, with 653 patients in the optimal outcome subgroup (368 male [56.4%]; 
mean age, 26.0 ± 10.2 years; mean body mass index [BMI], 26.5 ± 4.30) and 270 
patients in the suboptimal outcome subgroup (152 male [56.3%]; mean age, 35.0 ± 
10.1 years; mean BMI, 30.5 ± 5.54). The latter group demonstrated significantly 
increased rates of secondary meniscal injury, development of symptomatic PTOA, 
and progression to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) at the final follow-up (all P < 
.01). In the optimal outcome subgroup, ACLR had significantly protective 
treatment effects on the risk of secondary meniscal injury (average treatment 
effect [ATE], 61%), contralateral ACL injury (ATE, 8%), symptomatic PTOA (ATE, 
16%), and progression to TKA (ATE, 6%) (all P < .01). Conversely, in the 
suboptimal outcome subgroup, ACLR only protected against symptomatic PTOA (ATE, 
11%) and progression to TKA (ATE, 8%) (both P < .01).
CONCLUSION: Two clinically meaningful subgroups were identified from 
retrospectively collected data and found to experience differential treatment 
responses after ACL injuries. ACLR decreased the rate of development of PTOA and 
TKA in both subgroups but was not as effective in preventing secondary meniscal 
injuries or contralateral ACL injuries in patients who were older, heavier, or 
had concomitant medial meniscus injuries.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is characterized by kidney damage and abnormal 
renal energy metabolism, but the molecular mechanism of DKD is still unclear. In 
this study, we show that p16- positive senescent cells are an important 
regulator in the progression of DKD. The expression of p16 and senescence are 
increased in the kidneys of DM mice and DKD patients. To better understand the 
role of p16 in DKD, we induce type 1 diabetes in INK-ATTAC mice, a mouse model 
that allows the selective ablation of p16-expressing cells upon administration 
of the drug AP20187. We found that clearance of p16-positive cells, most of them 
are senescent cells, (1) decreased senescence and the expression of the 
components of the senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs), (2) 
restored kidney adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, (3) decreased the 
expression of the key glycolytic genes to improve the metabolic reprogramming, 
(4) normalized the mitochondrial metabolism through AMPK and mTOR pathway, 
resulting in an amelioration of the progression of DKD. In addition, p16 
mediated the blocking of the cell cycle is through the CDK4-Rb pathway in DKD 
kidneys. This study suggests that pharmacological deletion of p16-positive 
senescent cells may be a novel therapeutic strategy for DKD treatment.

BACKGROUND: One in five adults aged 40 will develop heart failure (HF) during 
their lifetime. Risk factors (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary 
artery disease, etc.) lead to structural and functional changes in 
cardiomyocytes, resulting in HF. At the cellular level, these changes consist of 
mis/over-expression of genes that regulate cardiac identity (e.g., CamK2δ, PKC, 
Stat3, etc.). The current paradigm for treating HF is pharmacological or 
device-based intervention; however, with few exceptions, the condition worsens 
with time. We are proposing to implement a change in HF treatment, shifting from 
a drug-centric system to a cardiac target-specific molecular approach that would 
reverse hypertrophy and adverse remodelling of affected cardiomyocytes.
METHODS: A cardiomyocyte targeting peptide (CTP) was reversibly linked to 
miRNA106a for delivery to a mouse model of HF. Reversal of morphological, 
signalling, and physiological HF parameters was measured. Additionally, 
CTP-miRNA106a was introduced into a human cardiomyocyte cell line to identify 
mechanism(s) at play for reversing HF characteristics (e.g., hypertrophy).
RESULTS: Bio-distribution studies showed that intravenously injected 
CTP-miRNA106 delivered its cargo specifically to the heart within 30 min, 
followed by clearance of CTP from the heart to the kidneys, and to a lesser 
extent, the liver by 35 h with persistence of miRNA106a in cardiomyocytes until 
day 7 (the latest tested time-point). CTP-miRNA106a reversed 
angiotensin2/isoproterenol-induced hypertrophy in 90% of the treated mice. We 
also identified two potential HF intracellular signalling pathways/mechanisms 
(PLCβ1/PKC/IP3 and NF-κB) targeted by CTP-miRNA106a that could benefit many 
pathophysiologies underlying HF, including inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: CTP-miRNA106a, a first-of-a-kind cardiac-specific drug, 
downregulates genes involved in cardiac hypertrophy and inflammation through the 
PLCβ1 and CamKIIδ kinase pathways. CTP delivery of miRNA106a cargo is specific 
to cardiomyocytes both in vitro and in vivo, and once delivered, many HF 
parameters, including hypertrophy, are reversed.
KEY POINTS: Cardiac Targeting Peptide (CTP) delivers, specifically to the heart, 
reversibly linked miRNA106a. MiRNA106a targets genes in various pathways known 
to cause heart failure when they are over/hyper activated returning their 
expression to normal levels. In vivo analyses using a mouse heart failure model 
resulted in reversal of heart failure parameters in 19/20 mice.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Symptomatic hydrocephalus (HCP) requiring 
cerebrospinal fluid diversion by shunting is routinely performed through 
ventriculoperitoneal or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunting. The optimal method of 
distal catheter placement for a VA shunt is not well defined. We detail a novel 
surgical technique for VA shunt placement using intraoperative digital 
subtraction angiography (DSA).
METHODS: The aim of this single-institution, retrospective review was to 
describe a unique technique of distal catheter placement in a series of the 
initial 50 consecutive adult patients who underwent VA shunt placement with DSA 
at our institution between 2021 and 2024. Detailed procedural techniques and 
outcomes are described.
RESULTS: Accurate surgical placement of the distal VA shunt was achieved in 48 
patients (96%). Five patients required shunt revisions for delayed shearing of 
distal catheter (1), suboptimal distal catheter placement (3), and suboptimal 
proximal catheter placement (1). Four instances of post-VA shunt bacteremia were 
found when patients were routinely cultured for febrile episodes; all completed 
appropriate antibiotic course, and none resulted in meningitis or required shunt 
revision. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated overall VA shunt success of 92% at 
3 years after initial surgery.
CONCLUSION: This series of 50 consecutive patients demonstrated use of 
intraoperative DSA yields safe and accurate placement VA shunts with acceptable 
long-term outcomes. As more neurosurgeons have endovascular training, this 
surgical technique may be more readily adopted.

BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy is an adoptive 
immunotherapy in which T cells are isolated from the patient and genetically 
modified ex vivo to express a CAR, thus enabling the CAR T-cells to target tumor 
cells. Currently, six Food and Drug Administration-approved CAR T-cell therapies 
target either CD19 for relapsed/refractory (R/R) B cell malignancies or B cell 
maturation antigen for R/R multiple myeloma. The success of these CAR T-cells 
has positioned this therapy as an important option for treating hematological 
malignancies and has also spurred efforts to use CAR T-cells to target solid 
tumors and to target nonmalignant B cell pathologies.
OBJECTIVE: The final functionality of CAR T-cells is influenced by the initial T 
cell subpopulations that were isolated, and naïve and memory phenotypes have 
been shown to yield superior final products. Our goal is to refine the T cell 
isolation method to enrich a naïve/memory T cell population for CAR T-cell 
production, while excluding cell subsets that could impair CAR T-cell product 
performance.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Healthy donor PBMCs were subjected to magnetic cell 
separation to deplete CD14+ cells, followed by a positive selection of CD127+ 
cells. The enriched CD14-CD127+ T cell population was characterized prior to CAR 
T-cell production. For comparison, we also generated CAR T-cells using 
CD14-CD25-CD62L+ T cells in an established method. Both CAR T-cell products were 
evaluated for production quality and compared in a series of activity assays.
RESULTS: A new isolation method was applied to healthy donor PBMCs to enrich a 
CD14-CD127+ T cell population. With this approach, B cell populations and 
monocytes were largely excluded from the final cell population, and extremely 
low percentages of CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) were detected. The 
enriched CD14-CD127+ T cell population was largely comprised of naïve, stem-like 
central memory, and central memory T cells. A BAFF-R targeted CAR (MC10029) was 
transfected into both CD14-CD25-CD62L+ T cells and CD14-CD127+ T cells from the 
same donor. Both CAR T-cell products exhibited similar cytotoxic performance.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed a new two-step isolation method for enriching 
CD14-CD127+ T cells from PBMCs. This method effectively excluded unwanted B 
cells, yet maintained the naïve, stem-like central memory and central memory T 
cells that can produce functional CAR T-cells.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is being explored for a growing range of 
applications in radiology, including image reconstruction, image segmentation, 
synthetic image generation, disease classification, worklist triage, and 
examination scheduling. However, training accurate AI models typically requires 
substantial amounts of expert-labeled data, which can be time-consuming and 
expensive to obtain. Active learning offers a potential strategy for mitigating 
the impacts of such labeling requirements. In contrast with other 
machine-learning approaches used for data-limited situations, active learning 
aims to produce labeled datasets by identifying the most informative or 
uncertain data for human annotation, thereby reducing labeling burden to improve 
model performance under constrained datasets. This Review explores the 
application of active learning to radiology AI, focusing on the role of active 
learning in reducing the resources needed to train radiology AI models while 
enhancing physician-AI interaction and collaboration. We discuss how active 
learning can be incorporated into radiology workflows to promote 
physician-in-the-loop AI systems, presenting key active learning concepts and 
use cases for radiology-based tasks, including through literature-based 
examples. Finally, we provide summary recommendations for the integration of 
active learning in radiology workflows while highlighting relevant 
opportunities, challenges, and future directions.

PURPOSE: Salvage radiation therapy (RT) is used in men with prostate cancer (PC) 
recurrence following radical prostatectomy (RP) signaled by a persistent or 
delayed elevation in PSA. It was previously reported that the use of AAT with RT 
improved cancer control and overall survival (OS). Long-term follow-up results 
are presented here.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1998-2003, 760 eligible post-RP patients with Stage 
pT3N0 or with pT2N0 and positive margins and PSA from 0·2 to 4·0 ng/mL were 
randomly assigned on a double blinded, placebo-controlled trial of RT + placebo 
vs. RT + anti-androgen therapy (AAT) (24 months of bicalutamide, 150mg daily) 
during and after RT (64·8 Gy in 36 fractions prostate bed). The primary endpoint 
was OS estimated using Kaplan-Meier method. Time to PC death and metastatic PC 
(competing risk of death without an event) was estimated using cumulative 
incidence. The hazard ratio (HR) was obtained using Cox models (OS) and 
subdistribution HRs (sHRs) used the Fine-Gray model (time to PC death and 
metastatic PC).
RESULTS: Median follow-up for surviving patients was 18·9 years. OS at 18 years 
was 53% [95% confidence interval (CI): 47-58%] for RT + AAT and 43% [95% CI: 
38-49%] for RT + placebo (adjusted HR 0·82 [95% CI: 0·67-1·00], one-sided 
p = 0·025). The 18-year incidence of centrally reviewed PC deaths were 18% [95% 
CI: 14-22%] RT + AAT and 28% [95% CI: 2333%] RT + placebo (unadjusted sHR = 0·63 
[95% CI: 0·46-0·84], two-sided p=0·002). The 18year incidence of metastatic PC 
was 22% [95% CI: 18-26%] and 31% [95% CI: 26-36%] for AAT and placebo arms 
respectively with unadjusted sHR = 0·62 [95% CI: 0·46-0·83, two-sided p=0·001].
CONCLUSIONS: Long term results of 24-month duration AAT during and after salvage 
RT are consistent with the primary report with significantly improved long-term 
OS, reduced incidence of metastatic PC and PC death for RT+AAT. In comparison to 
previous reports, the improvement in overall survival with AAT has risen from 5% 
at 12 years to 9·8% at 18 years.

BACKGROUND: There have been growing sentiments that the Uniform Determination of 
Death Act needs to be revised. One suggestion is to include a conscience clause, 
that is, allowing patients to "opt-out" of brain death determination. 
Understanding public attitudes toward a conscience clause may help inform 
policymakers and future proposed revisions. Therefore, we sought to investigate 
informed public attitudes toward continued medical support after the 
determination of brain death.
METHODS: A nationwide online survey was distributed by a third-party provider. 
The survey had three components: (1) a 2-min educational video that explains 
five basic facts of brain death, (2) a validated five-item questionnaire to 
measure understanding of brain death, and (3) a six-item questionnaire to 
measure informed public attitudes toward a family's request to continue medical 
support for a patient with brain death. Attitudes were measured on a seven-point 
Likert scale. A multiple linear regression model was developed to identify 
predictors of attitudes toward opting out of brain death. Analysis of variance 
with a post hoc Tukey test was used to compare attitudes across categorical 
demographic variables.
RESULTS: We collected 1386 responses from participants across 49 states. The 
average five-item knowledge score was 88%. A total of 41.9% of all participants 
agreed that the hospital should be required to continue treatment for an 
individual with brain death if their family rejects brain death. A total of 
24.4% and 27.3% of participants would request further treatment for themselves 
and a family member after a determination of brain death, respectively. Multiple 
linear regression identified attitudes for oneself and for a family member, age 
greater than 65 years, understanding that brain death is legal death, and male 
sex as predictors of attitudes toward requiring continued treatment (F(6, 
1380) = 142.74, adjust R2 = 0.38, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of the participants would require hospitals to continue 
treatment for families who reject brain death as death. Future discussions on 
revising the Uniform Determination of Death Act to adopt a conscience clause 
should consider informed public attitudes.

The evaluation of claudin-18 (CLDN18) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has already 
entered routine diagnostic activity as a predictive biomarker for patients with 
gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas. Of note, the CLDN18 gene 
encodes for 2 isoforms, claudin-18.1 (CLDN18.1) and 18.2 (CLD18.2). Recent 
evidence has shown CLDN18.2 can be expressed in a relatively high rate of cases 
of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Based on these findings, preclinical 
research has been conducted, and clinical trials are currently underway testing 
anti-CLDN18.2 targeted regimens for patients affected by locally advanced 
unresectable and metastatic PDAC. Notably, the therapeutic strategies with 
specific antibodies are directed against CLDN18.2, while the antibody for IHC 
recognizes both isoforms, CLDN18.1 and CLDN18.2. Since CLDN18.1 is not expressed 
in the stomach or in the pancreas, IHC for CLDN18 in these sites can be 
considered specific for the isoform CLD18.2. At this time, no specific practical 
testing or interpretation guidelines have been proposed in this setting. 
However, there are several preanalytical and analytical variables and key 
potential pancreas-specific pitfalls, such as the frequently diffuse and strong 
CLDN18.2 expression in PDAC precursors, which will likely interfere with 
adequate CLDN18 staining and interpretation. To overcome these issues and steer 
the standardization of CLDN18 evaluation within the PDAC framework, this 
manuscript provides practical guidance on CLDN18 testing and scoring. The 
adoption of a standardized approach will help align all the efforts, both in 
research and clinical trial settings to optimally guide the most appropriate 
patients for anti-CLDN18.2 targeted therapies in PDAC.

Extracellular vesicles (EV) are phospholipid-encapsulated nanoparticles secreted 
by cells into their surrounding environment. EVs can transfer a variety of 
biomolecules that mediate intercellular communication and play a key role in 
physiological and pathological processes. Therefore, EVs are emerging as new 
biomarkers for diseases, therapeutic targets, and drug delivery vehicles. The 
isolation and detection of EVs requires time-consuming and labor-intensive 
processes, first to extract EVs from biological and physiological fluids and 
then to detect EV-associated molecules with high sensitivity. The methodologies 
and instruments commonly used for EV analysis are not widely accessible outside 
of dedicated research laboratories, creating practical barriers for the study of 
EV-associated molecules in biology research and clinical applications. To bridge 
this gap, we developed a proof-of-concept digital microfluidic device that can 
automatedly extract EVs from 20 µL of culture and human plasma samples within 25 
min and detect EV-bound proteins (e.g PD-L1) on-chip using an electrochemical 
sensor. This work serves as a framework for the development of streamlined EV 
analysis in both research and diagnostics.

Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanic/Latino individuals, yet many 
do not complete cancer screenings due to systemic barriers. To address this 
issue, Rochester Healthy Community Partnership (RHCP) created "Stories for 
Change: La detección temprana puede salvar vidas" (S4C-cancer prevention). This 
digital storytelling intervention involved eight Hispanic/Latino cancer 
survivors or co-survivors who shared their experiences by creating 2-min videos. 
Their heartfelt stories aim to help patients make informed decisions about 
cancer screenings. RHCP piloted S4C-cancer prevention at three clinical sites to 
assess intervention acceptability and success (cancer screenings completed). A 
total of 51 participants who were overdue for cancer screenings were recruited 
(breast = 13; cervical = 12; colorectal women = 14; colorectal men = 12). After 
viewing the intervention, 100% intended to be screened in the future. Within 
7 months, 45% of participants completed their recommended cancer screenings. 
Among those who were screened, 89% stated that their decision was "very much" 
influenced by S4C-cancer prevention. Participants who did not complete screening 
cited barriers such as time, lack of access to health education, and fear. Those 
who had previously screened for the targeted cancer were more likely to complete 
screening after viewing S4C-cancer prevention. Additionally, participants 
suggested enhancing the videos by including more education on various cancer 
topics. We found high acceptability of S4C-cancer prevention. Despite all 
participants intending to get screened, half completed screening within 7 months 
of viewing the intervention.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The long-term efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in 
patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) were evaluated in the 
U-ENDURE long-term extension (LTE) study. Here we report the results after 
2 years of total maintenance treatment.
METHODS: U-ENDURE is an ongoing 240-week LTE study conducted at 243 sites across 
in 43 countries (first patient enrolled in LTE 21 March 2019). Patients who 
completed the 52-week maintenance study continued their previously assigned 
treatment, once-daily upadacitinib 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg. Efficacy and 
safety were assessed through LTE week 48 for patients in the 52-maintenance 
study and LTE study (cumulative maintenance population) and the LTE study only 
(cutoff date: 19 December 2023).
RESULTS: From LTE week 0 to week 48, as-observed efficacy rates for clinical 
remission (per stool frequency/abdominal pain score, upadacitinib 15 mg: 78.3% 
to 82.9%; upadacitinib 30 mg: 84.7% to 76.6%; per CD Activity Index, 
upadacitinib 15 mg: 81.3% to 83.1%; upadacitinib 30 mg: 86.1% to 86.8%), 
endoscopic response (upadacitinib 15 mg: 59.6% to 67.1%; upadacitinib 30 mg: 
71.2% to 69.6%), inflammatory biomarkers, and quality-of-life outcomes remained 
stable. The safety profile of the cumulative maintenance population observed 
through LTE week 48 was consistent with previous trials in the upadacitinib CD 
program. Treatment-emergent adverse event rates for the cumulative maintenance 
population were 283.1 and 273.4 events/100 patient-years for upadacitinib 15 mg 
and upadacitinib 30 mg, respectively. Event rates of serious treatment-emergent 
adverse events were 16.0 events/100 patient-years for upadacitinib 15 mg and 
14.6 events/100 patient-years for upadacitinib 30 mg. The most common adverse 
events of special interest (≥ 5.0 events/100 patient-years) were hepatic 
disorder, lymphopenia, creatine phosphokinase elevation, herpes zoster, and 
anemia. There was 1 treatment-emergent adverse event of suicide leading to 
death.
CONCLUSION: Sustained clinical, endoscopic, quality-of-life, and biomarker 
outcomes were observed in patients who were initial responders to upadacitinib 
and completed 2 years of maintenance therapy, with no new safety signals 
identified.

BACKGROUND: Early allograft dysfunction (EAD) affects outcomes in liver 
transplantation (LT). Existing risk models developed for deceased-donor LT 
depend on posttransplant factors and fall short in living-donor LT (LDLT), where 
pretransplant evaluations are crucial for preventing EAD and justifying the 
donor's risks.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data from 2944 adult patients who 
underwent LDLT at 17 centers between 2016 and 2020. We developed a logistic 
regression model to predict EAD based on this development cohort. We used data 
from 1020 patients at the King Faisal Transplant Center for external validation.
RESULTS: In the development cohort, 321 patients (10.9%) experienced EAD. These 
patients had poorer health status, more liver decompensation, and higher 
requirements of hospitalization than those without EAD. Multivariable logistic 
regression identified independent pretransplant predictors of EAD: laboratory 
Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 1.06-1.09), the necessity for hospitalization at the time of 
transplant (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 2.00-3.30), and graft weight in kilogram (OR, 
0.27; 95% CI, 0.17-0.45). Using these predictors, we developed the model for EAD 
after LDLT, which demonstrated strong discriminative ability in the development 
cohort with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.68-0.74). The model 
maintained high discrimination during internal validation (AUC, 0.70; 95% CI, 
0.67-0.73) and showed a modest reduction in discriminative power in external 
validation (AUC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.61-0.68).
CONCLUSIONS: EAD post-LDLT is influenced by the recipient's pretransplant health 
condition and the graft weight. Integrating the model for EAD after LDLT into 
the pretransplant process of pairing donors and recipients can enhance the 
safety and efficacy of LDLT.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The relevance of Cochrane systematic reviews depends 
on timely completion and updates. This study aimed to empirically assess the 
lifecycles of Cochrane reviews published from 2003 to 2024, including 
transitions from protocol to review, update patterns, and withdrawals.
METHODS: We extracted data from Cochrane Library publications between 2003 and 
2024. Each review topic was identified using a unique six-digit DOI-based ID. We 
recorded protocol publication, review publication, updates, and withdrawals 
(i.e., removed from the Cochrane Library for editorial or procedural reasons), 
calculating time intervals between stages and conducting subgroup analyses by 
review type.
RESULTS: Of 8137 protocols, 71.9% progressed to reviews (median 25.7 months), 
2.4% were updated during the protocol stage, and 10.0% were withdrawn. Among 
8477 reviews, 64.3% were never updated by the time of our analysis; for those 
updated at least once, the median interval between updates was 57.2 months. 
Withdrawal occurred in 2.5% of reviews (median 67.6 months post-publication). 
Subgroup analyses showed variation across review types; diagnostic and 
qualitative reviews tended to have longer protocol-to-review times than other 
types of reviews.
CONCLUSIONS: Cochrane reviews show long development and update intervals, with 
variation by review type. Greater use of automation and targeted support may 
improve review efficiency and timeliness.

BACKGROUND: The increasing incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer (age <50 
years; EOCRC) shows a dramatic growing trend globally, while late-onset 
colorectal cancer (LOCRC) is gradually decreasing. We aimed to characterise the 
distinct mutational landscape of EOCRC in an effort to inform age-specific 
clinical management.
METHODS: In this observational study, we analysed whole-exome sequencing and 
clinical-grade targeted sequencing data from seven cohorts (the Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC] cohort [the USA], the Leiden University Medical 
Center cohort [the Netherlands], the Nigerian African Research Group for 
Oncology [ARGO] cohort [Nigeria], the Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information 
Exchange [GENIE] Project [Canada, France, Spain, and the USA], the Sun Yat-sen 
University Cancer Center (SYSUCC) cohort [China], the Asan Medical Center cohort 
[South Korea], and the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center-Colorectal Cancer 
[FUSCC-CRC] cohort [China]) across Canada, China, France, Nigeria, South Korea, 
Spain, the Netherlands, and the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or 
older with a confirmed diagnosis of colorectal adenocarcinoma or mucinous 
adenocarcinoma. Samples were categorised into hypermutated (tumour mutational 
burden [TMB] >15 mutations per megabase) and non-hypermutated (TMB ≤15 mutations 
per megabase) groups. We evaluated the TMB difference between EOCRC and LOCRC 
using gamma regression and compared genomic mutation data between EOCRC and 
LOCRC using multiple logistic regression and pathway enrichment analysis. The 
primary study objective was to compare genomic mutational patterns between EOCRC 
and LOCRC, stratified by TMB groups.
FINDINGS: Between Jan 1 and Dec 31, 2024, 17 133 tumour samples from patients 
with colorectal cancer in eight countries were analysed (Canada [n=218], China 
[n=3009], France [n=62], Nigeria [n=64], South Korea [n=44], Spain [n=250], the 
Netherlands [n=281], and the USA [n=13 205]). Among 17 133 patients, 9452 
(55·2%) were male, 7681 (44·8%) were female, 10 174 (59·4%) were White, 3904 
(22·8%) were Asian or Pacific Islander, 983 (5·7%) were Black, and 4983 (29·1%) 
had EOCRC. In hypermutated colorectal cancer, EOCRC exhibited a significantly 
higher TMB compared with LOCRC (mean ratio 1·11 [95% CI 1·06-1·16]; p<0·0001). 
In non-hypermutated colorectal cancer, EOCRC showed a significantly lower TMB 
than LOCRC after adjusting for skewness (mean ratio 2·92 [95% CI 2·88-2·96]; 
p<0·0001). In hypermutated colorectal cancer, a total of 23 genes, including APC 
(EOCRC 464 [75·0%] of 619 vs LOCRC 891 [58·6%] of 1521; odds ratio [OR] 2·00 
[95% CI 1·59-2·51]; adjusted p<0·0001), KRAS (EOCRC 331 [53·3%] of 621 vs LOCRC 
488 [32·0%] of 1526; OR 2·35 [95% CI 1·91-2·89]; adjusted p<0·0001), and CTNNB1 
(EOCRC 196 [31·6%] of 621 vs LOCRC 274 [18·0%] of 1526; OR 2·15 [95% CI 
1·70-2·72]; adjusted p<0·0001), and TCF7L2 (EOCRC 294 [51·2%] of 574 vs LOCRC 
489 [35·0%] of 1398; OR 2·01 [95% CI 1·62-2·50]; adjusted p<0·0001), displayed 
elevated mutation frequencies in EOCRC compared with LOCRC, whereas only BRAF 
(EOCRC 97 [15·6%] of 621 vs LOCRC 674 [44·2%] of 1526; OR 0·27 [95% CI 
0·21-0·35]; adjusted p<0·0001) and RNF43 (EOCRC 225 [39·3%] of 573 vs LOCRC 778 
[53·9%] of 1444; OR 0·61 [95% CI 0·49-0·76]; adjusted p=0·0015) were less 
frequently mutated in EOCRC than in LOCRC. In non-hypermutated colorectal 
cancer, only TP53 (EOCRC 3468 [79·5%] of 4362 vs LOCRC 7825 [73·7%] of 10 624; 
OR 1·37 [95% CI 1·25-1·50]; adjusted p<0·0001) showed a higher mutation 
frequency in EOCRC, while nine genes had lower mutation frequencies, including 
BRAF (EOCRC 274 [6·3%] of 4362 vs LOCRC 909 [8·6%] of 10 624; OR 0·70 [95% CI 
0·60-0·81]; adjusted p=0·00024) and KRAS (EOCRC 1794 [41·1%] of 4362 vs LOCRC 
4840 [45·6%] of 10624; OR 0·83 [95% CI 0·77-0·89]; adjusted p=0·00019).
INTERPRETATION: Within hypermutated colorectal cancer, younger patients 
exhibited a higher mutational burden than older patients. Our study reveals an 
abnormal accumulation of distinct somatic mutations in hypermutated EOCRC, the 
pattern of which might be contributing to the alarming rise in the incidence of 
EOCRC over the past decades. Our results support the need for EOCRC-specific 
molecular profiling to guide clinical practice.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proximal protection devices, such as TransCarotid Artery 
Revascularization (TCAR), aim to yield better outcomes in carotid artery stent 
placement (CAS) than distal protection devices by preventing plaque embolization 
to the brain. However, transfemoral catheters may not fully reverse flow from 
the external carotid artery (ECA) to the ICA. We assess a new balloon-sheath 
device, Femoral Flow Reversal Access for Carotid Artery Stent placement 
(FFRACAS), for this purpose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The FFRACAS prototype (inner diameter [ID] = 0.117 
inches; L = 80 cm) was compared with TCAR (ID = 0.104 inches, L = 30 cm) and 
Mo.Ma (ID = 0.083 inches, L = 90 cm) in a pulsatile flow model with blood 
simulant at 800 mL/min. Mo.Ma was used according to labeled instructions, with 
both CCA and ECA balloon inflation, without CCA-femoral vein shunt placement, 
and in an off-label fashion with single balloon occlusion in the CCA and shunt. 
Flow rates of the ICA, ECA, and shunt, when applicable, were monitored during 
CAS stages: CCA flow arrest, shunt activation, and stent delivery. Experiments 
were conducted under 2 ECA inflow conditions (-10 and -20 mL/min). Statistical 
comparison of ICA flow rates was conducted by using ANOVA and Tukey post hoc 
tests.
RESULTS: The on-label use of Mo.Ma maintained retrograde ICA flow (-0.3 mL/min) 
throughout CAS. On shunt activation, TCAR and FFRACAS reversed ICA flow 
similarly under low ECA inflow (ICA = -5.10 mL/min versus -4.83 mL/min; P = 
.349), but neither achieved ICA flow reversal under high ECA inflow or during 
stent delivery. Mo.Ma off-label use failed to reverse ICA flow.
CONCLUSIONS: FFRACAS presents a potential alternative to TCAR, achieving similar 
degrees of flow reversal from a transfemoral approach to that achieved with the 
transcarotid approach. The Mo.Ma system reliably prevents anterograde flow in 
ICA during CAS.

BACKGROUND: Non-acute or chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is commonly treated 
with surgical evacuation followed by middle meningeal artery embolization 
(MMAe). This two step approach increases procedural complexity and redundancy, 
hospitalization duration, and patient risk. We hypothesized that cSDH could be 
managed through a single session endovascular procedure and conducted a 
multimodal preclinical study to evaluate feasibility.
METHODS: We performed three-dimensional heat mapping of hematoma distribution 
from preoperative CT scans (n=69) and analyzed middle meningeal artery (MMA) and 
superior sagittal sinus (SSS) anatomy and perforation trajectories using imaging 
from 107 patients. Rheological properties of 41 SDH samples were assessed using 
hybrid rheometry and modeled with the Carreau equation. Aspiration feasibility 
was tested using a 0.027 inch microcatheter (n=16), and dura perforation forces 
were quantified with a 28 G needle in fresh cadaveric dura (n=10).
RESULTS: Heat mapping localized cSDH to the parietal convexities (>80% 
probability) under the branches of the MMA, with limited midline involvement and 
proximity to the SSS (<10%). The posterior division of the MMA (diameter 
1.23±0.23 mm) accommodated a 0.027 inch microcatheter in >90% of cases, with 
perforation trajectories targeting high probability hematoma zones in 105 of 107 
cases. SDH samples exhibited shear thinning viscosity (η ₀=172 mPa×s, η 
∞=2.78 mPa×s), with mean aspiration times of 1.21±0.54 min per 10 mL. 
Perforation forces averaged 0.68±0.24 N in normal and 1.29±0.48 N in calcified 
dura (P=0.05).
CONCLUSION: Anatomical, rheological, and biomechanical data from this study 
support the feasibility of endovascular drainage of cSDH through the MMA.

Gallstones are a common biliary disorder whose pathogenesis may involve 
alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), an acute phase inflammatory protein. Serum uric 
acid (SUA) is the end product of purine metabolism and is associated with a 
variety of chronic diseases. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 1,652 
adult women from the 2017-2020 NHANES database to explore the association 
between AGP levels and gallstone risk and the potential mediating role of SUA. 
We used multivariate logistic regression, restricted cubic spline curves, 
subgroup analyses, and causal mediation analyses to evaluate the association 
between serum AGP levels and gallstone risk.Serum AGP levels were significantly 
associated with gallstone risk. After correcting for covariates, the highest AGP 
quartile (≥ 0.950 g/L) was associated with a 1.72-fold higher risk of gallstones 
compared to the lowest quartile (≤ 0.629 g/L) (OR = 2.72,95% CI: 1.31-5.65; 
p = 0.014). Subgroup analyses revealed stronger associations in non-Hispanic 
whites, low-income individuals, and smokers. SUA partially mediated the 
AGP-gallstone relationship, accounting for 14.76% of the total effect. This 
study found that AGP levels were significantly associated with gallstone risk in 
US adult women, and serum uric acid played a mediating role. Future research 
should further investigate the causal relationship and its applicability in 
different populations.

PURPOSE: To compare measurements of intraocular pressure (IOP) by four 
mechanistically different tonometers in healthy participants from the Eye 
Dynamics and Engineering Network (EDEN) Aqueous Humor Dynamics (AHD) clinical 
trial using mean difference estimation, equivalence statistics and adjusting for 
proparacaine's effects on IOP.
DESIGN: Multicenter open-label clinical trial in healthy adults (NCT01677507).
PARTICIPANTS: Enrolled were 122 participants (55.2 ± 8.8 y; 92 females, 30 
males), 121 of which had measurements with and without proparacaine.
METHODS: Participants from three sites had their IOPs measured with iCare™ 
rebound tonometer (RT), Ocular response analyzer corneal-compensated (CC), 
pneumatonometer (PN), and Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT). IOP readings 
with RT and CC were collected with and without proparacaine.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Effect sizes and agreement in IOP measurements from the 
four tonometers was analyzed with Data Analysis using Bootstrap-Coupled 
Estimation (DABEST), Bland-Altman Limits of Agreement (LoA), Lin's Concordance 
Correlation Coefficient (CCC), and robust equivalence (TOST-two one-sided tests) 
in tandem with null hypothesis significance testing. DABEST was used to analyze 
differences in IOP readings from RT and CC before and after administering 
proparacaine.
RESULTS: DABEST, LoA, and CCC showed greatest effect size and poorest agreement 
between PN and the other tonometers. The lowest mean difference was seen when 
comparing GAT and CC. However, LoA and CCC found the strongest agreement between 
RT and GAT. TOST revealed tonometers can be considered equivalent to one another 
at ± 2 mmHg, except for PN. After applying proparacaine, IOP decreased 
significantly (p < 0.0001) by RT (1.2 ± 1.9 mmHg OD; 1.1 ± 1.7 mmHg OS), and CC 
(1.4 ± 1.8 mmHg OD; 1.3 ± 2.3 mmHg OS).
CONCLUSIONS: When adjusted for proparacaine's effect on IOP, three tonometers 
were equivalent between each other when determined by equivalence statistical 
testing with equivalence bounds ± 2 mmHg. The pneumatonometer reads greater than 
2 mmHg higher than RT, CC, or GAT. Therefore, when comparing IOP data from 
different tonometers, one should consider that not all tonometer measurements 
are interchangeable and the proparacaine effect should be considered.

OBJECTIVE: To improve tissue contrast visualization in water-only images from 
two-point turbo spin-echo (TSE) Dixon MRI using dark-fat image processing and 
evaluate in retrospectively acquired clinical knee images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical knee MRI datasets from 36 patients were 
retrospectively compiled under IRB approval. The dark-fat water-only images were 
generated and compared with the conventional water-only images from two-point 
TSE-Dixon MRI. The water-only images from 20 patients were analyzed: (i) 
qualitatively by two experienced musculoskeletal radiologists, for overall image 
quality, fat suppression, anatomical visualization, and the absence of 
artifacts, using Wilcoxon rank tests, and (ii) quantitatively using apparent 
signal-to-noise ratio (aSNR) and apparent contrast-to-noise ratio (aCNR) from 
regions of interest (ROIs) with paired t-test. In the remaining 16 patients, the 
number of cruciate ligament tears identified on MRI was tabulated and compared 
with arthroscopy results.
RESULTS: Compared to conventional water-only images, dark-fat water-only images 
showed improved fat suppression (reader 1, P < 0.0001; reader 2, P < 0.05), 
improved overall image quality by reader 1 (P < 0.001), and improved 
visualization of the sciatic nerve for reader 1 (P < 0.01), while there were no 
significant differences for the other anatomical structures. aSNR was 
significantly reduced for bone marrow fat (P < 0.0001), and aCNR between 
meniscus and articular cartilage was significantly improved (P < 0.0001). There 
were a higher number of posterior cruciate ligament tears identified in MRI 
compared to arthroscopy.
CONCLUSION: Dark-fat processed water-only images improved fat suppression and 
tissue contrast visualization, particularly sciatic nerves, compared to 
conventional water-only images from two-point TSE-Dixon MR imaging.

Ballistic fractures of the wrist and forearm warrant special consideration due 
to the proximity of neurovascular structures. Each case requires a thorough 
assessment for concomitant peripheral nerve and vascular injury as well as the 
presence of possible development of compartment syndrome, which may be difficult 
to detect in the setting of the multiply injured patient. The extent of bony and 
soft tissue injury with the degree of contamination present should be factored 
into decisions regarding antibiotic treatment and surgical debridement, and the 
strategy for fracture stabilization and management of osseous defects should be 
tailored to the individual.

BACKGROUND: Medical chaperones are authorized individuals present during 
physical examinations involving the genitals, breasts/chest, or anal areas. The 
use of medical chaperones may provide an opportunity to improve transgender and 
gender diverse (TGD) patients' experiences with sensitive examinations.
AIM: To examine TGD adult patients' preferences and comfort for having a medical 
chaperone and whether TGD-specific characteristics, social anxiety symptoms, and 
feelings of medical mistrust are associated with preference for having a medical 
chaperone present during a sensitive physical examination.
METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional survey that randomly sampled adult 
patients from a gender clinic in the Midwest region of the U.S. A total of 420 
surveys were mailed. Sixty-two surveys were returned undeliverable, 358 reached 
recipients; 151 were returned (42.1% response rate). The survey included items 
related to demographics, gender-related anatomical dysphoria, social anxiety 
symptoms, feelings of medical mistrust, and preference and comfort towards 
medical chaperones.
RESULTS: Among 149 respondents, 74 (49.7%) reported comfort for the idea of 
having a medical chaperone present during a sensitive physical examination, 50 
(33.6%) reported neutral comfort, and 25 (16.8%) reported discomfort. Among 147 
respondents, 89 (60.5%) endorsed a preference for a female medical chaperone. We 
found no associations between gender-related anatomical dysphoria or social 
anxiety symptoms and comfort for having a medical chaperone, or the gender 
preference for a medical chaperone. Medical mistrust was associated with lower 
comfort with having a medical chaperone present during a sensitive physical 
examination.
CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Routinely offering medical chaperones, especially female 
chaperones, is like to be generally acceptable to most TGD patients. These 
findings may inform clinic policies on providing medical chaperones during 
sensitive examinations.
STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: This study is the first to examine TGD preferences 
for medical chaperones. Findings are limited by a single site, homogeneous 
sample, cross-sectional design, and reliance on hypothetical rather than 
observed examinations.
CONCLUSION: TGD adults report comfort with the concept of having a medical 
chaperone during sensitive examinations and most would prefer the chaperone to 
be female. Preference for having a medical chaperone present during a sensitive 
physical exam is not likely influenced by gender dysphoria or social anxiety.

IMPORTANCE: Obesity is associated with a higher risk of recurrence, mortality, 
comorbidities, treatment-related adverse effects, and poor quality of life in 
patients with breast cancer. Scalable interventions are needed to promote weight 
loss in this population.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a remotely delivered weight loss 
intervention (WLI) on weight change at 1 year in patients with breast cancer and 
obesity and to explore factors associated with weight change.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Breast Cancer Weight Loss trial is a 
phase 3, randomized clinical trial evaluating the impact of a telephone-based 
WLI on invasive disease-free survival and other outcomes in women with obesity 
and early breast cancer at 637 sites across the US and Canada. Participants were 
enrolled to the study between August 2016 and February 2021. Participants 
included women with stage II to III, ERBB2-negative breast cancer and a body 
mass index (BMI) of 27 or higher.
INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to a 2-year, telephone-based WLI 
plus health education or health education alone control group.
MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary end point for this prespecified secondary 
analysis was weight change at 1 year. Weight was measured at baseline and 1 
year, and changes in weight were compared between groups. Weight change was 
evaluated with a linear mixed-effects model including treatment group, weight 
over time, a time-by-group interaction, menopausal status, race and ethnicity, 
and hormone receptor status.
RESULTS: A total of 3180 women with breast cancer and BMI of 27 and higher were 
included in the study; 1591 were randomized to the WLI and 1589 to the control 
group. At baseline, the mean (SD) age of participants was 53.4 (10.6), and the 
mean (SD) BMI was 34.4 (5.6). The racial and ethnic breakdown included 406 
(12.8%) Black, 231 (7.3%) Hispanic or Latino, 2906 (91.4%) non-Hispanic, and 
2555 (80.3%) White participants. WLI participants lost a mean of 4.3 kg (95% CI 
3.9-4.6 kg), or 4.7% (95% CI, 4.3%-5.0%) of baseline body weight at 1 year vs 
control participants, who gained 0.9 kg (95% CI, 0.5-1.3 kg), or 1.0% (95% CI 
0.1%-1.4%) of baseline body weight (P < .001). Participants randomized to WLI 
experienced significant weight loss (vs control group participants) across 
demographic and tumor factors. WLI effect differed significantly by menopausal 
status, with postmenopausal participants having greater weight loss than 
premenopausal participants, and by race and ethnicity, with Black and Hispanic 
participants having less weight loss compared to other races and ethnicities.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical 
trial, a telephone-based WLI induced significant weight loss in patients with 
breast cancer with overweight and obesity across demographic and treatment 
factors. Further follow-up of the Breast Cancer Weight Loss trial will evaluate 
whether the WLI improves disease outcomes.

Ageing of the cardiovascular system is associated with frailty and various 
life-threatening diseases. As global populations grow older, age-related 
conditions increasingly determine healthspan and lifespan. The circulatory 
system not only supplies nutrients and oxygen to all tissues of the human body 
and removes by-products but also builds the largest interorgan communication 
network, thereby serving as a gatekeeper for healthy ageing. Therefore, 
elucidating organ-specific and cell-specific ageing mechanisms that compromise 
circulatory system functions could have the potential to prevent or ameliorate 
age-related cardiovascular diseases. In support of this concept, emerging 
evidence suggests that targeting the circulatory system might restore organ 
function. In this Roadmap, we delve into the organ-specific and cell-specific 
mechanisms that underlie ageing-related changes in the cardiovascular system. We 
raise unanswered questions regarding the optimal design of clinical trials, in 
which markers of biological ageing in humans could be assessed. We provide 
guidance for the development of gerotherapeutics, which will rely on the 
technological progress of the diagnostic toolbox to measure residual risk in 
elderly individuals. A major challenge in the quest to discover interventions 
that delay age-related conditions in humans is to identify molecular switches 
that can delay the onset of ageing changes. To overcome this roadblock, future 
clinical trials need to provide evidence that gerotherapeutics directly affect 
one or several hallmarks of ageing in such a manner as to delay, prevent, 
alleviate or treat age-associated dysfunction and diseases.

Suicide is a leading cause of death in adolescents, and a spectrum of suicidal 
thoughts and behaviors (STBs) is common among teenagers. Adolescence is a 
transitional period marked by critical brain changes, coinciding with major 
changes in how teenagers regulate emotions and impulses, as well as in how they 
understand themselves and interact with others. We review neuroimaging evidence 
supporting a developmental conceptualization of suicide risk, focusing on neural 
changes associated with key developmental tasks of adolescence. Functional and 
structural imaging studies have implicated medial prefrontal, cingulate, 
dorsolateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and frontolimbic circuitry changes in 
youth with STBs. There is emerging evidence that psychotherapeutic and 
neuromodulatory interventions can engage these brain processes and modify 
behavior in at-risk youth. We argue that harnessing these techniques more 
specifically by using targeted approaches aimed at enhancing emotion regulation, 
impulse control, positive identity development, and healthy social functioning 
is a promising way forward for reducing suicide risk in teens. Continued 
investigation into neural trajectories of suicidality in adolescence is critical 
for developing more effective risk assessment and treatment approaches to aid 
suicidal youth in navigating adolescent development and transitioning 
successfully to adulthood.

OBJECTIVES: This research aimed to understand how sleep site selection compared 
to other study sites in baboons living in a low-predator density, highly 
seasonal environment. We compared baboon troops in two distinct habitat types 
with different seasonal influences within the park, one that flooded annually 
and one that did not. We compared their sleep site use, reuse, and location 
relative to home range boundaries and areas of interest (AOIs) with each other 
and baboons in other areas to understand whether season, habitat familiarity, or 
position in the home range influenced sleep site choice.
METHODS: Using GPS collar data taken at 15-min intervals from four gray-footed 
chacma baboons (Papio ursinus griseipes) in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique, 
we established the location of sleep sites, home range boundaries, and AOIs, or 
places where the baboons repeatedly stopped for more than 15 min. Study subjects 
ranged either in dense woodland or in a seasonally flooded alluvial floodplain. 
We used a linear mixed-effects model to predict sleep site reuse based on 
distance to the habitat edge and AOIs, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to 
determine if morning or evening AOIs influenced sleep site location. We counted 
the number of reuses of each sleep site before and after the flooding period and 
compared this data to data in other baboon study sites.
RESULTS: We found that, as in other study sites with less seasonality and higher 
predation risk, baboons in Gorongosa change sleep site frequently and utilize 
multiple sleep sites throughout their home range, although they more often use 
sleep sites closer to the center of their home ranges. However, unlike other 
studies, we found that the location of the last AOI of the day more strongly 
predicted sleep site location than the first AOI of the next day in one troop, 
with baboons traveling further from their sleep site to their first AOI in the 
morning than from their last evening AOI to the sleep site.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite high seasonality and low predator density, baboons in 
Gorongosa National Park changed sleep sites frequently, as do other studied 
baboon troops in areas with high nocturnal predation rates. In addition, their 
propensity to sleep closer to the last AOI of the day may imply that they plan 
their daily paths toward their chosen sleep site, or that they sleep 
opportunistically at the end of the day. This study provides a baseline of 
behavioral data for comparison to other sites and future work in Gorongosa, 
where predator density continues to rise since the time of the study.

OBJECTIVE: The present investigation aimed to 1) develop a new CT-based 
assessment of endplate bone density (endplate Hounsfield unit [EP-HU]) and 2) 
analyze if EP-HU was a better predictor than vertebral Hounsfield unit (HU) for 
subsidence after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).
METHODS: All adult patients who underwent one- to three-level ACDF with a 
titanium interbody for radiculopathy and/or myelopathy at an academic center 
between 2018 and 2020 were retrospectively identified. Based on preoperative 
sagittal CT scans (left, right, and middle cuts), 2-mm superior and inferior 
endplate regions were circumscribed with the free draw tool to account for 
endplate surface undulations. The average of the superior and inferior EP-HUs on 
all CT cuts was used to calculate EP-HU. Cervical vertebral HUs were determined 
from the average of axial CT cranial, middle, and caudal cuts circumscribing 
only trabecular bone. The interbody subsidence of the cranial and caudal 
endplates of each ACDF level was directly measured on the endplate-facing 
surface of both coronal and sagittal cuts of postoperative CT scans (at 1 year) 
to determine the maximum subsidence (subsidence defined as ≥ 2 mm). Univariate 
and stepwise logistic regression analyses were used to compare subsidence based 
on CT bone metrics. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were 
used to determine the probability of subsidence based on EP-HUs and vertebral 
HUs.
RESULTS: A total of 35 patients were included. Subsidence occurred at 32 of 67 
unique fusion levels. Subsidence was associated with older age (p = 0.008), 
diabetes diagnosis (p = 0.015), and decreased interbody length (p = 0.019). 
EP-HUs exhibited moderate correlation with cervical vertebral HUs (Pearson's ρ = 
0.63). Subsidence was significantly associated with decreased total EP-HUs 
(subsidence: 475 HU, no subsidence: 543 HU; p = 0.019) and decreased lumbar 
vertebral HUs (subsidence: 296 HU, no subsidence: 341 HU; p = 0.011). ROC curve 
analysis identified an optimal EP-HU cutoff of 512.30 (area under the curve 
[AUC] = 0.701) to predict subsidence. The AUC of the vertebral HUs with respect 
to subsidence was 0.662. EP-HUs < 512.30 predicted subsidence (OR 6.67, p = 
0.001) independent of significant demographic and surgical factors.
CONCLUSIONS: CT cervical EP-HUs rather than vertebral cervical trabecular HUs 
may be more efficacious in predicting subsidence after ACDF.

Mechanical Power: Using Ideal Body Weight to Identify Injurious Mechanical 
Ventilation Thresholds.

Identifying the mechanisms of ventilator/ventilation-induced lung injury 
requires an understanding of the pulmonary physiology involved in the mechanical 
properties of the lung along with the involvement of the inflammatory cascade. 
Accurately measuring parameters that represent physiologic lung stress and lung 
strain at the bedside can be clinically challenging. Although surrogates for 
lung stress and strain have been proposed, such as plateau pressure and driving 
pressure, these values only represent a static variable in the ventilator 
breath. It has been proposed that a single variable could be used as a unifying 
parameter to identify a threshold for the safe application of mechanical 
ventilation. The concept of "mechanical power" applies an energy load transfer 
designation to the ventilator settings and output of tidal volume, airway 
pressures, and flow. However, there is a potential disconnect between the use of 
"absolute" mechanical power and the variability of body weight throughout a 
mixed medical population. Using ideal body weight as an influential factor to 
express mechanical power can potentially allow for a more accurate depiction of 
energy applied to the lungs and a potentially reliable injurious mechanical 
ventilation threshold indicator.

BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a prevalent condition among postmenopausal women, 
significantly increasing the risk of fragility fractures. Despite the 
availability of clinical guidelines, their implementation in primary care, 
remains highly variable, particularly regarding fracture prevention and shared 
decision-making (SDM).
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study to explore the attitudes and practices 
of Spanish family physicians in preventing fractures among postmenopausal women. 
Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with physicians from diverse 
socioeconomic backgrounds and levels of clinical experience. Data were analysed 
using an iterative, theory-driven approach to identify key themes and barriers.
RESULTS: Physicians showed substantial variability in fracture risk assessment 
approaches, frequently combining tools such as FRAX with clinical judgment. Most 
were cautious about prescribing bisphosphonates for primary prevention, citing 
concerns about the strength of the evidence and potential adverse effects. While 
non-pharmacological strategies, such as lifestyle modifications and fall 
prevention, were emphasized, their implementation was often constrained by 
workload pressures. Patient involvement in decision-making was hindered by 
widespread misconceptions about osteoporosis and its treatment, as well as the 
lack of appropriate decision-support tools. Participants highlighted the need 
for clearer guidelines, enhanced educational resources, and accessible decision 
aids to facilitate patient engagement in care.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the complex challenges family physicians face 
in fracture prevention among postmenopausal women, including heterogeneity of 
recommendations in guidelines, limited SDM implementation, and systemic barriers 
within primary care. Addressing these issues will require multifaceted 
interventions targeting both healthcare system constraints and patient 
education. Future efforts should focus on developing and implementing strategies 
that support evidence-based, patient-centred decision-making while accounting 
for the realities of primary care practice.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Choroidal nevus necessitates regular monitoring due to 
its potential for malignant transformation. We identified features associated 
with lost to follow-up (LTFU), delayed follow-up (DFU), and appropriate 
follow-up (AFU) in choroidal nevus patients.
SUBJECTS/METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analysed 825 adults diagnosed 
with choroidal nevus between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015, in Olmsted 
County, Minnesota. Patient demographics, tumour features, and clinical outcomes 
were assessed according to follow-up status.
RESULTS: Among the patients, 82 (9.9%) were LTFU, 317 (38.4%) had DFU, and 426 
(51.6%) had AFU. Comparing groups (LTFU vs. DFU vs. AFU), LTFU patients were 
younger (mean age 44.5 vs. 53.3 vs. 59.7 years, p < 0.001) and primarily 
diagnosed by optometrists (64.6% vs. 64.4% vs. 41.1%, p < 0.001) on routine 
visits (56.1% vs. 69.7% vs. 45.8%, p < 0.001). They had lower Charlson 
comorbidity index (0.4 vs. 0.5 vs. 0.7, p = 0.005) and less systemic cancer 
history (9.5% vs. 15.7% vs. 22.7%, p = 0.013). LTFU and DFU had better visual 
acuity (>20/50) compared to AFU (93.9% vs. 94.6% vs. 88.5%, p = 0.019). AFU had 
larger tumour dimensions (basal diameter: 2.5 mm vs. 2.3 mm vs. 2.8 mm, 
p = 0.003; thickness: 0.1 mm vs. 0.1 mm vs. 0.2 mm, p < 0.001). More LTFU 
patients had a mean initial recommended follow-up time of 12 months compared to 
DFU and AFU (80.5% vs. 78.9% vs. 74.2%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with LTFU in choroidal nevus patients include 
younger age, lower comorbidity index, absence of cancer history, optometrist 
diagnosis, routine visit diagnosis, better visual acuity, less suspicious tumour 
features, and longer follow-up recommendation.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the oncologic outcomes in patients treated for UTUC by 
radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) relative to their smoking history in a 
contemporary cohort that includes use of neoadjuvant and intravesical 
chemotherapy.
METHODS: We analyzed a multi-institutional cohort of patients treated with RNU 
for UTUC between 2000-2020. Patients were classified as never smokers, those 
with a <20 pack year smoking history, and those with a ≥20 pack years of smoking 
history. Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival, intravesical 
recurrence, contralateral upper tract recurrence, and metastasis were compared.
RESULTS: 1796 patients were included. No significant differences in the risks of 
intravesical recurrence, contralateral upper tract recurrence, metastasis, or 
cancer-specific survival were identified based on smoking status. OS was 
significantly higher in the never smoking group, with hazard ratio for death of 
1.38 (95% CI 1.09-1.73) for <20 pack years smoking history and 1.34 (95% CI 
1.12-1.61) for ≥20 pack years smoking history (p=0.002). Rates of intravesical 
recurrence and OS were improved among smokers who received intravesical 
chemotherapy compared to those who did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of RNU for UTUC with any smoking history 
had worse overall survival compared to those with no smoking history, but no 
differences were seen in intravesical, contralateral upper tract, and 
extraurothelial recurrence or in cancer-specific survival. Counseling on smoking 
cessation remains an important element of ongoing care to optimize health 
outcomes in these patients.

Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) represents the standard of care 
therapy for patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); 
however, the rate of BCG-unresponsive disease remains high. Cystectomy is the 
most definitive treatment for patients with this disease entity but is 
associated with significant morbidity and quality-of-life implications. 
Recently, several single-arm clinical trials have been conducted to develop 
alternative treatment options for patients who are ineligible for or decline 
cystectomy based on guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As 
a result, several therapeutic options have now emerged, including nadofaragene 
firadenovec-vncg, an intravesical gene therapy that induces interferon (IFN)-α2b 
gene expression with resultant direct and indirect anti-tumor effects within the 
bladder. Today, nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg represents the first-line 
treatment option for patients with BCG-unresponsive disease as an alternative to 
cystectomy. Advances in our knowledge of the tumor microenvironment, gene 
therapy techniques, and tumor biology have contributed to this important 
discovery, with future studies aimed to optimize the efficacy of this therapy 
through improved patient selection, disease prognostication, and development of 
combination strategies.

Plain Language Summary: Nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg is a new treatment for 
bladder cancer that uses gene therapy. This approach delivers a gene into the 
bladder that helps produce a protein called interferon, which can reduce cancer 
growth and survival. This treatment is mainly used for patients whose cancer has 
returned or persisted after receiving a standard treatment called bacillus 
Calmette-Guerin (BCG). In this article, we review how nadofaragene 
firadenovec-vncg was developed, how it works, and what clinical studies have 
shown about its safety and effectiveness, to better understand its place in the 
evolving landscape of bladder cancer care.

PURPOSE: Radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) is the gold standard treatment for 
high-risk upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). However, the oncologic 
control afforded by RNU may be accompanied by significant renal function 
decline. Data regarding patients with immediate end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
after RNU is limited. Herein, we investigate outcomes of patients undergoing RNU 
who were dialysis-dependent prior to surgery or rendered anephric by surgery 
relative to a matched control cohort.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried our multi-institutional RNU database to 
identify patients with preoperative ESRD (n = 16) or solitary kidney (n = 12). 
We matched these 1:2 to a control cohort of RNU patients using age, sex, 
Charlson Comorbidity Index, smoking status, and pathologic T-stage. Oncologic 
and survival outcomes were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: The two groups had similar baseline clinical and oncologic 
characteristics, including utilization of perioperative systemic therapy. There 
was no significant difference in time to recurrence or cancer specific 
mortality. However, the dialysis cohort displayed a higher risk of overall 
mortality, with 3- and 5-year survival of 29% and 14%, compared to 60% and 57% 
in the control group (HR 2.13, P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing RNU with immediate postoperative ESRD had 
similar oncologic outcomes but worse overall survival compared to matched 
controls. These results are likely related to the impact of ESRD and other 
nononcologic comorbidities, which must factor into treatment decisions. For 
those who ultimately elect RNU, all efforts should be made to optimize any 
potentially reversible comorbidities after surgery.

BACKGROUND: Secondary shoulder deformities are the most frequent sequelae of 
upper trunk-type brachial plexus birth injury (BPBI). Coracoid process dysplasia 
was recently described as being associated with glenoid retroversion and was 
recognized to block successful humeral head relocation. There are little to no 
reports on coracoid process deformity causing anterior shoulder pain. Our 
hypothesis is that coracoid process impingement causes anterior shoulder pain in 
BPBI, which is relieved by coracoid excision. This study presents the short-term 
results of this new technique in BPBI patients.
METHODS: A retrospective review identified BPBI patients who underwent coracoid 
excision from 2000 to 2022. Indications for this procedure include BPBI patients 
with anterior shoulder pain limiting the range of motion, localized tenderness 
over a prominent coracoid process, a dysplastic coracoid process seen on 
imaging, and persistent pain despite activity modification, medication, and 
therapy. Patient characteristics, preoperative shoulder pain score, range of 
motion, degree of glenohumeral subluxation, patient-reported outcomes 
measurement information system (PROMIS) scores for pain interference, and 
physical and upper extremity function were collected from chart review. 
Postoperative pain scores, range of motion, and PROMIS scores were collected at 
an average of 1 year after excision.
RESULTS: Five upper trunk BPBI patients, ages 10 to 25 years old, with anterior 
shoulder pain underwent coracoid excision. All had statistically significant 
pain relief from 6.5-8.5/10 before to 0-3/10 after the procedure. Forward 
flexion and external rotation improved by an average of 18 degrees. The pain 
interference score decreased by 25%. There was a 33% improvement in physical 
function scores and a 31% increase in upper extremity function scores. No 
complications or recurrence were observed at 7.5 months to 1 year and 7 months 
after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Coracoid excision is a simple procedure that can relieve localized 
shoulder pain caused by coracoid impingement in adolescent/adult BPBI. Continued 
follow-up of all patients will be undertaken to determine long-term recurrence 
rates and complications.

INTRODUCTION: Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is defined by neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs) with absent-minimal amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques. Currently, 
definitive diagnosis of PART occurs with autopsy. This study investigated 
whether [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) could 
detect PART-related metabolic changes and assessed the impact of common 
co-pathologies.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of 88 individuals 
(mean age 85.6) with autopsy-confirmed PART (Braak I to IV; Thal phases 0 to 2) 
who underwent ante mortem FDG-PET. Visual ratings and standardized uptake value 
ratios (SUVRs) were analyzed in medial and lateral temporal lobes, inferior 
temporal pole, precuneus, and posterior cingulate regions.
RESULTS: Medial temporal hypometabolism was observed in PART, in the presence of 
co-pathologies. Argyrophilic grain disease and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 were 
associated with greater hypometabolism (p < 0.01). Lewy body disease affected 
parietal regions.
DISCUSSION: FDG-PET reveals that PART-related hypometabolism occurs when 
co-pathologies are present, but PART alone appears to have minimal effect on 
medial temporal lobe hypometabolism.
HIGHLIGHTS: FDG-PET hypometabolism worsens with Braak NFT stage. FDG-PET detects 
mild lateral temporal lobe hypometabolism in PART alone. PART alone has a 
minimal effect on medial temporal lobe hypometabolism. Medial temporal 
hypometabolism is worse in PART with TDP-43 and especially AGD. The presence of 
LBD contributes to parietal hypometabolism on FGD-PET in PART.

BACKGROUND: There is a need for additional high quality studies in children's 
orthopaedic surgery to answer important clinical research questions. The purpose 
of this study was to develop a consensus-based research agenda to identify top 
clinical questions to prioritize in pediatric orthopaedics.
METHODS: A modified Delphi technique was used, where the membership of the 
Pediatric Orthopaedic Society of North America (POSNA) was asked to submit 
clinical research questions and then queried iteratively to gain consensus. A 
steering committee from the POSNA leadership members was assembled to 
administer, consolidate, and edit survey responses. Final scores were used to 
select the top 16 research questions distributed by subspecialty area.
RESULTS: Based on the call for clinical research questions, 78 orthopaedic 
surgeons and scientists submitted 116 research questions. The steering committee 
removed duplicate questions and harmonized submissions to 65 clinical research 
questions. In spring 2024, the POSNA membership participated in stage 1 voting 
and submitted 33 additional questions. Duplicate questions were removed. The 
final voting round included 108 surgeons who rated 54 questions from low (1) to 
high priority (5). The top scoring questions from each subspecialty area were 
selected to comprise the POSNA consensus-based clinical research agenda. The top 
scoring questions were related to the role of orthopaedic surgical treatment in 
cerebral palsy and surgical indications for residual hip dysplasia.
CONCLUSIONS: This consensus-based research agenda may guide surgeons, 
researchers, study group consortia, and funding organizations to improve the 
clinical evidence in children's orthopaedic surgery and promote high-quality 
prospective studies.
KEY CONCEPTS: (1)Despite the significant burden and cost of pediatric 
musculoskeletal conditions, pediatric orthopaedic research receives low research 
funding, underscoring the need for a focused research agenda.(2)This study used 
a modified Delphi process to engage pediatric orthopaedic surgeons across 
multiple pediatric orthopaedic subspecialties in the development of a 
consensus-based research agenda in order to identify high-priority clinical 
questions.(3)The final agenda reflects critical gaps in pediatric orthopaedic 
care, including conditions that impact long-term function and quality of life in 
pediatric orthopaedic patients.(4)The final agenda aims to guide future 
research, foster multicenter collaboration, and advocate optimized allocation of 
funding to improve evidence-based pediatric orthopaedic care.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV (consensus-based expert opinion study).

IMPORTANCE: Thyroid cancer incidence has tripled in the past 3 decades, largely 
driven by increased detection of small, indolent papillary thyroid cancers. 
Overuse of thyroid ultrasonography (TUS) contributes to overdiagnosis, leading 
to unnecessary biopsies, procedures, and potential patient harm.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of and factors associated with 
inappropriate TUS (iTUS) orders and assess related clinical outcomes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 
adult patients 18 years and older who underwent their first TUS from January 1, 
2017, to December 30, 2021, at 4 Mayo Clinic sites. Patients with previous 
thyroid nodule, thyroid cancer, thyroid surgery, or TUS were excluded. Based on 
documented clinical indications, a validated natural language processing model 
classified TUS orders as appropriate or inappropriate. Data were analyzed from 
April 2024 to May 2025.
EXPOSURES: Baseline characteristics of patients, clinicians, and clinical 
encounters investigated for their association with an iTUS order.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of iTUS 
orders. Secondary outcomes included factors associated with iTUS 
(sociodemographic, clinical, order-specific, and clinician-related factors) and 
clinical outcomes following iTUS, including the detection of thyroid nodules, 
thyroid procedures, and thyroid cancer diagnoses.
RESULTS: Of 11 442 included patients, 8422 (73.6%) were female, and the mean 
(SD) age was 57.3 (15.8) years with a mean (SD) body mass index (calculated as 
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 29.7 (7.0). Among 
11 442 TUS orders, 866 (7.6%) were classified as inappropriate. In multivariable 
analysis, younger age (age of 18 to 54 years vs older than 65 years; odds ratio 
[OR], 1.86; 95% CI, 1.56-2.22), hyperthyroidism (OR, 9.04; 95% CI, 6.75-12.11), 
ordering by nonendocrinology specialties (eg, oncology/hematology; OR, 3.43; 95% 
CI, 2.47-4.76), and orders not linked to an in-person appointment (eg, portal 
messages; OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 2.08-2.82) were strongly associated with increased 
odds of iTUS. Compared with appropriate TUS, iTUS led to lower rates of thyroid 
nodule detection (202 of 866 [23.3%] vs 6885 of 10 576 [65.1%]; OR, 0.16; 95% 
CI, 0.14-0.19), biopsies (89 [10.3%] vs 2647 [25.0%]; OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 
0.27-0.43), partial thyroidectomies (14 [1.6%] vs 424 [4.0%]; OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 
0.23-0.67), and confirmed thyroid cancer cases (16 [1.8%] vs 425 [4.0%]; OR, 
0.45; 95% CI, 0.27-0.74).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, approximately 1 in 13 TUS 
orders were inappropriate. iTUS was more common in younger patients, those with 
thyroid dysfunction, those not seen in person, and in those referred by 
nonendocrinology specialties. These findings highlight the need for targeted 
strategies to optimize TUS use and mitigate overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

Seronegative neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a diagnostic 
challenge. This study aimed to characterize misapplication of the 2015 
international criteria for seronegative NMOSD. We reviewed 35 consecutive 
seronegative NMOSD referrals to a tertiary center. Two (6%) met formal criteria, 
and 2 (6%) were clinically suspected of NMOSD without fulfilling radiologic 
supportive criteria. Alternative diagnoses were common including multiple 
sclerosis (37%), optic neuritis (14%), functional neurologic disorder (11%), and 
other (38%). Immunosuppression with rituximab was used in 3 of 4 patients with 
functional neurologic disorder. Misapplication of the 2015 criteria is common, 
and alternative explanations in seronegative NMOSD patients should be strongly 
considered.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) 
often relies on the integration of various clinical, radiological, and 
histopathological data. Achieving high diagnostic accuracy in ILDs, particularly 
for distinguishing usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), is challenging and 
requires a multidisciplinary approach. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a 
multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that combines computed 
tomography (CT) and histopathological images to improve the accuracy and 
consistency of UIP diagnosis.
METHODS: A dataset of CT and pathological images from 324 patients with ILD 
between 2009 and 2021 was collected. The CT component of the model was trained 
to identify 28 different radiological features. The pathological counterpart was 
developed in our previous study. A total of 114 samples were selected and used 
for testing the multimodal AI model. The performance of the multimodal AI was 
assessed through comparisons with expert pathologists and general pathologists.
RESULTS: The developed multimodal AI demonstrated a substantial improvement in 
distinguishing UIP from non-UIP, achieving an AUC of 0.92. When applied by 
general pathologists, the diagnostic agreement rate improved significantly, with 
a post-model κ score of 0.737 compared to 0.273 pre-model integration. 
Additionally, the diagnostic consensus rate with expert pulmonary pathologists 
increased from κ scores of 0.278-0.53 to 0.474-0.602 post-model integration. The 
model also increased diagnostic confidence among general pathologists.
CONCLUSION: Combining CT and histopathological images, the multimodal AI 
algorithm enhances pathologists' diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and 
confidence in identifying UIP, even in cases where specialised expertise is 
limited.

Objective: To evaluate the function and safety of the SteadiSet™ infusion set 
over a continuous 7-day wear period in adults with type 1 diabetes. Research 
Design and Methods: Participants used a SteadiSet infusion set with a t:slim X2™ 
insulin pump with Control-IQ™ technology, and either insulin aspart or insulin 
lispro, for a target of 7 days for 12 consecutive wear periods. Each set removed 
before 7 days was adjudicated by an independent committee to assess the cause of 
early removal and to determine whether criteria for primary or key secondary 
endpoints were met. Results: There were 260 participants who inserted 3028 
infusion sets. For the primary endpoint, the Kaplan-Meier 7-day survival 
estimate was 95% (95% CI 94% to 96%). For the key secondary endpoint, which 
expanded the reasons for a failed infusion set, the Kaplan-Meier 7-day survival 
estimate was 84% (95% CI 82% to 86%). For both endpoints, the P value was <0.001 
compared with a prespecified survival rate of 75%. Time-in-range 70-180 mg/dL 
(TIR) increased through day 3 of set wear and then decreased through day 7, with 
the average TIR being 70.6% over the entire wear period across all infusion 
sets, including those that failed. An increase in total daily insulin was 
observed from day 4 through day 7. Conclusions: The 7-day survival of the 
SteadiSet infusion set was very high for the primary endpoint and at an 
acceptable level with respect to early removal for any reason related to the 
device.

Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, with heart failure (HF) 
recognized as its most severe and debilitating manifestation. Though remarkable 
advancements have led to the establishment of life-saving and 
quality-of-life-enhancing medical and device-based therapies for HF, HF-related 
mortality trends have increased over the past decade. To combat this worldwide 
epidemic, care must evolve so that preventative recommendations are not siloed 
from HF management. Prevention must be prioritized more broadly, not only in the 
early detection and deterrence of HF, but across a patient's lifespan in 
conjunction with therapeutic intervention. Members of the Heart Failure Society 
of America and the American Society for Preventive Cardiology created this joint 
Societal Scientific Statement on the Prevention of Heart Failure to emphasize 
the links between cardiovascular disease prevention and HF and offer a 
conceptual roadmap along which to consider all aspects of preventative care. 
This includes primary prevention to reduce the burden of HF, secondary 
prevention to reduce the impact of HF among those with an established diagnosis 
of HF, and tertiary prevention, which encompasses the management of risk factors 
in patients who require advanced therapies, including durable mechanical 
circulatory support and heart transplantation.

The opioid crisis in the United States has grown increasingly complex as it 
enters its fourth decade. Synthetic opioids and psychostimulants now contribute 
to significant morbidity and mortality. Despite recent declining trends in 
overdose deaths, they remain magnitudes higher compared with the early years of 
the crisis. Against this backdrop, our institution formed an Opioid Stewardship 
Program in 2017 with representation from multiple disciplines and across 5 US 
states. Our mission was to establish and to maintain opioid analgesic 
prescribing and monitoring best practices through the development of guidelines, 
risk mitigation strategies, electronic health record tools, dashboards, and 
leadership push reports as well as education for patients and staff. As the 
epidemic evolved, we shifted our focus to opioid use disorder (OUD) screening 
and treatment, and community engagement. We continued to keep our institutional 
leadership abreast of regulatory and guideline updates-keeping them accountable 
for upholding best practices. Work to date has yielded improvements in opioid 
prescribing trends, enhanced awareness and knowledge of clinic staff across 
disciplines, and increasing numbers of patients with OUD receiving treatment. 
Much remains to be done, but we remain optimistic that our ongoing efforts will 
drive continued improvements-ultimately saving lives and improving access to OUD 
treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer's 
disease (LOAD) differ in many respects. Here, we address the issue of possible 
differences in fibrillar amyloid pathology as measured by positron emission 
tomography (PET), which remains unresolved due to the lack of large-scale 
comparative studies.
METHODS: Three hundred ninety-nine cognitively impaired participants younger 
than 65 years of age from the multicenter Longitudinal Early-onset Alzheimer's 
Disease Study (LEADS) and 450 cognitively impaired participants older than 
65 years from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) underwent 
clinical assessment, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and amyloid PET and 
were included in this study. We compared amyloid PET outcomes (positivity rate 
based on visual read and quantified tracer uptake expressed as Centiloids [CLs]) 
between the 2 cohorts and studied their association with age, sex, APOE 
genotype, and cognition.
RESULTS: The amyloid positivity rate was higher in LEADS (78%, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] = 74-82) than in ADNI (71%, 95% CI = 67-75, p = 0.02). Lower 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and APOE4 genotype increased the odds of 
amyloid positivity in both cohorts. Visually positive scans had higher CLs in 
LEADS (EOAD, mean = 95.3 ± 26.1) than in ADNI (LOAD, mean = 80.9 ± 36.8, 
p < 0.0001), predominantly in parietal cortex/precuneus, superior temporal, and 
frontal cortices. In amyloid-positive patients, (1) CLs were higher in female 
patients in both cohorts; (2) APOE4 carriership was associated with lower CLs in 
EOAD, which was not observed in LOAD; and (3) correlations between CLs and MMSE 
scores were significantly stronger in EOAD than in LOAD.
INTERPRETATION: Differences in the burden of amyloid pathology may contribute to 
differences in clinical and anatomic patterns in sporadic EOAD and LOAD, and 
have implications for optimizing therapeutic strategies in each group. ANN

BACKGROUND: Incidental pulmonary emboli (IPE) are frequently overlooked by 
radiologists. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been developed to aid 
detection of pulmonary emboli.
OBJECTIVES: To measure diagnostic performance of AI compared with prospective 
interpretation by radiologists.
PATIENTS/METHODS: A commercially available AI algorithm was used to 
retrospectively review 14,453 contrast-enhanced outpatient CT CAP exams in 9171 
patients where PE was not clinically suspected. Natural language processing 
(NLP) searches of reports identified IPE detected prospectively. Thoracic 
radiologists reviewed all cases read as positive by AI or NLP to confirm IPE and 
assess the most proximal level of clot and overall clot burden. 1,400 cases read 
as negative by both the initial radiologist and AI were re-reviewed to assess 
for additional IPE.
RESULTS: Radiologists prospectively detected 218 IPE and AI detected an 
additional 36 unreported cases. AI missed 30 cases of IPE detected by the 
radiologist and had 94 false positives. For 36 IPE missed by the radiologist, 
median clot burden was 1 and 19 were solitary segmental or subsegmental. For 30 
IPE missed by AI, one case had large central emboli and the others were small 
with 23 solitary subsegmental emboli. Radiologist re-review of 1,400 exams 
interpreted as negative found 8 additional cases of IPE.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with radiologists, AI had similar sensitivity but reduced 
positive predictive value. Our experience indicates that the AI tool is not 
ready to be used autonomously without human oversight, but a human observer plus 
AI is better than either alone for detection of incidental pulmonary emboli.

BACKGROUND: The phase 3 BELLINI primary endpoint was met, showing superior 
progression-free survival with venetoclax versus placebo plus bortezomib and 
dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma as 
assessed by an independent review committee. However, venetoclax showed 
increased early mortality. Here, we report the final overall survival analysis.
METHODS: The randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase 3 BELLINI study 
enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less, and 
one to three previous therapies, across 90 hospitals in 16 countries. Eligible 
patients were centrally randomly assigned (2:1, stratified by previous 
proteasome inhibitor exposure and number of previous lines of therapies) via 
interactive response technology system (block size 3) to once-daily venetoclax 
(800 mg orally) or placebo with bortezomib (1·3 mg/m2 subcutaneously or 
intravenously) and dexamethasone (20 mg orally), administered in 21-day cycles 
for initial eight cycles, followed by 35-day cycles until discontinuation. The 
primary endpoint was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent 
review committee in the intention-to-treat population; this analysis reports 
overall survival and investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the 
intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in patients who 
received at least one dose of the study drug. This study is registered with 
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02755597) and is completed.
FINDINGS: From July 19, 2016, to Oct 31, 2017, 291 patients were assigned to 
venetoclax (n=194) or placebo (n=97); 33 patients (28 in the venetoclax group 
and five in the placebo group) remained on treatment at the time of this 
analysis. Of the 291 patients, 152 (52%) were men and 139 (48%) were women. 87 
(30%) of 291 patients were Asian, 12 (4%) were Black or African American, 190 
(65%) were White, and 32 (11%) were Hispanic or Latino. At 45·6 months (IQR 
43·6-48·3) median follow-up, median overall survival was not reached in the 
venetoclax group (not reached [NR] [95% CI 44·4-not estimable]) or in the 
placebo group (NR [95% CI 44·0-not estimable]; HR 1·19 [95% CI 0·80-1·77]); 
p=0·39). Median progression-free survival was 23·4 months (95% CI 16·2-26·4) 
with venetoclax versus 11·4 months (95% CI 9·5-14·6) with placebo (HR 0·58 [95% 
CI 0·43-0·78]; p=0·00026). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 
thrombocytopenia (51 [26%] of 193 in the venetoclax group vs 38 [40%] of 96 in 
the placebo group]) and neutropenia (58 [30%] of 193 vs eight [8%] of 96 
patients). Treatment-related adverse events led to death in four (2%) of 193 
patients in the venetoclax group (two patients with pneumonia, one with death, 
and one with both multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and septic shock) and none 
in the placebo group.
INTERPRETATION: Final overall survival analysis in the BELLINI study showed 
overall survival favouring placebo over venetoclax and progression-free survival 
favouring venetoclax over placebo, indicating venetoclax usage should be avoided 
in the general relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma population.

BACKGROUND: Neuronal loss and the presence of tau lesions in specific brain 
regions is required for a definitive diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy 
(PSP). We previously found tau burden in basal ganglia and red nucleus to be 
associated with disease duration and age at death. It is currently unknown 
whether neuronal loss is also associated with disease duration and age at death, 
or with antemortem brain volume loss in PSP.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether neuronal loss is associated with tau burden, 
age at death, disease duration, or brain volume loss in PSP.
METHODS: Forty-one pathologically confirmed PSP participants prospectively 
recruited and followed by the Neurodegenerative Research Group (NRG), Mayo 
Clinic, MN, between 2009 and 2023, of which 40 completed antemortem MRI, were 
analyzed. Neuronal loss in the subthalamic and red nuclei was determined on 
hematoxylin and eosin. Multinomial logistic regressions with age at death, 
disease duration, and brain volume as independent variables, and regional 
neuronal loss as outcome, were performed.
RESULTS: Fourteen participants (34 %) were female, median age at death was 74 
years [68, 79], and median disease duration was 8.2 years [5.7, 9.9]. Greater 
neuronal loss was associated with greater burden of glial, but not neuronal, tau 
lesions in both nuclei. Greater neuronal loss was associated with shorter 
disease duration in both nuclei, particularly in the subthalamic nucleus, and 
smaller volume on MRI of the red nucleus.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuronal loss in subthalamic and red nuclei, cardinal PSP regions, 
appear to be playing a role in disease duration and brain volume loss in PSP.

Patients with obesity are the largest and fastest-growing demographic among 
individuals with renal failure in the United States. Transplant centers often 
reject patients with high body mass index due to risks of post-transplant 
complications. Metabolic bariatric surgery, the most efficient and durable 
weight loss method, can facilitate a timely kidney transplant listing and 
improve obesity-related comorbidities in a relatively safe manner. In this 
review, we identify kidney transplant candidates who are likely to benefit from 
MBS, discuss the potential risks of this procedure, and propose post-surgery 
monitoring and management to optimize safety and maximize the benefits of this 
therapy.

The gut microbiome forms an ecosystem that provides the host with numerous 
benefits such as digestion with nutrient generation, protection from pathogens 
and immune system maturation. Alterations in the microbial ecosystem associated 
with rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis have led to the gut-joint 
hypothesis, which postulates that these ecological changes cause immune 
dysfunction that contributes to the development of arthritis. Mechanisms by 
which dysbiosis might trigger arthritis include molecular mimicry, dysregulation 
of mucosal immunity, microbial translocation, production of immunomodulatory 
metabolites and immune cell trafficking. We discuss the data supporting each of 
these mechanisms, and highlight misconceptions, limitations and gaps in 
knowledge. In particular, we advise against the term 'leaky-gut' as the 
mechanisms and effects on the immune system of intestinal permeability and 
bacterial translocation are distinct. Nevertheless, rheumatoid arthritis and 
spondyloarthritis possibly result from the convergence of multiple pathways that 
could be unique to subgroups of individuals within these diseases. To move the 
field forward, each mechanism needs to be considered through the use of model 
organisms and interventional trials, individually and in concert.

Calaspargase pegol is currently the only pegylated asparaginase product 
accessible to children, adolescents, and young adults aged 1 month to 21.5 years 
in the United States. Despite a growing recognition of its real-world toxicity 
profile, hypertriglyceridemia has not yet been described in depth with 
calaspargase pegol. Herein we describe our clinical observations of six patients 
who experienced significant hypertriglyceridemia following exposure to 
calaspargase pegol, warranting intensive care in several cases. Potential 
confounding risk factors and management strategies of this presumed toxicity are 
explored.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between hormone therapy use and 
severe outcomes due to COVID-19 in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.
METHODS: Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we retrospectively searched 
for the records of women aged 40-65 years who had a documented case of COVID-19 
between March 12 and September 29, 2020. We further identified those who were 
perimenopausal or postmenopausal. The rates of emergency department visits, 
hospitalizations, and deaths were compared by hormone therapy use. Logistic 
regression models were used to assess the odds of the combined outcome based on 
hormone therapy use.
RESULTS: Among the 689 patients included in this study, the median age was 56 
years, and 77.5% were White. Compared with patients currently using hormone 
therapy, those with past/never use of hormone therapy were significantly older, 
had more risk factors for severe COVID-19, and had a higher incidence of 
diabetes. A total of 102 emergency department visits/hospitalizations/deaths 
occurred among both groups. Participants with current hormone therapy use had 
similar rates and risk of emergency department/hospitalization/death outcomes as 
those without hormone therapy, even after adjusting for age and severe COVID-19 
risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe COVID-19 outcomes were not significantly different between 
women with current versus past/never use of hormone therapy. Our study adds to 
the data suggesting no harm with hormone therapy use in women with severe 
symptoms of COVID-19.

PURPOSE: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major health issue affecting maternal 
and neonatal well-being. Labor pain is a significant psychophysiological 
stressor, and its association with PPD is not completely understood. This study 
investigated the relationship between the effectiveness of labor epidural 
analgesia (LEA), measured as percentage improvement in pain (PIP), and the risk 
of PPD at six weeks postpartum.
METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study, 156 women were 
enrolled. Participants self-selected whether to receive LEA. Pain intensity was 
assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale, and PPD symptoms were assessed using 
the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) on postpartum day 3 and at six 
weeks postpartum.
RESULTS: A moderate positive correlation was observed between LEA satisfaction 
and PIP (rs = 0.389, P < 0.001). A small but significant negative correlation 
was found between LEA satisfaction and EPDS scores (rs =  - 0.268, P = 0.007). 
However, PIP was not significantly associated with the risk of PPD. PPD 
prevalence did not significantly differ between the LEA group (7.9%) and the 
non-LEA group (12.7%) (P = 0.491).
CONCLUSION: While the use of LEA provided effective pain relief, it was not 
associated with the risk of PPD. Maternal perception of pain relief may have

Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy characterized by 
non-caseating granulomatous inflammation that results in significant morbidity 
and mortality. It has become increasingly recognized over the past several 
decades; however, diagnosis remains challenging due to its heterogeneous nature 
and limited diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy. As such, there has been 
increasing reliance on advanced cardiac imaging to aid in the diagnosis and 
management of CS. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((Al-Kindi and 
Oliveira, 201518)FDG-PET) has emerged as the most robust imaging modality and 
remains the preferred method for assessing active inflammation, treatment 
response, and surveillance. Nevertheless, it requires meticulous patient 
preparation and image acquisition to ensure optimal imaging and interpretation. 
This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the various imaging 
modalities used for the diagnosis of CS, with a particular focus on the 
intricacies of (Al-Kindi and Oliveira, 201518)FDG-PET, including the latest 
advancements in patient preparation and study interpretation. Other future 
directions for the diagnosis and management of CS will also be discussed.

BACKGROUND: Preparation of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) using 
covered stent placement is a common preparatory step for transcatheter pulmonary 
valve replacement (TPVR) to reduce the risk of disruption associated with 
dilating calcified RVOT conduits.
AIM: We present a novel method employing a self-expanding covered aortic 
endoprosthesis and discuss its advantages as an alternative strategy.
METHODS: Patients with congenital heart disease undergoing RVOT conduit 
preparation with the GORE TAG Thoracic Branch Endoprosthesis Extender (W.L. Gore 
& Associates, Newark, DE) followed by TPVR, were prospectively enrolled in a 
dedicated database. To date, 14 patients have been included. Data on 
demographics, diagnoses, procedural details, hemodynamic parameters, and 
outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Fourteen patients (median age: 35 years [range: 18-79]; 57% female) 
successfully underwent endograft placement immediately before TPVR. Treated 
conduits included pulmonary homografts (n = 8), surgical bioprostheses (n = 2), 
Hancock conduit (n = 1), Contegra conduit (n = 1), native RVOT (n = 1), and 
Melody valve within a surgical bioprosthesis (n = 1). Most patients presented 
with mixed stenosis and regurgitation (n = 9), with the remaining having 
stenosis (n = 4) or regurgitation (n = 1). Valves implanted post-preparation 
included the Sapien S3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) (n = 10) and the 
Melody valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) (n = 5). Significant reductions in 
RVOT systolic gradient were observed (median 34 mmHg pre-procedure to 3 mmHg 
post-procedure), along with marked conduit expansion (median diameter 13 mm 
pre-procedure to 25.5 mm post-procedure). No complications were reported.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the feasibility of a self-expanding aortic 
endoprosthesis for RVOT preparation before TPVR. Further comparative study is 
warranted. Procedural success was achieved in all cases.

PURPOSE: PT-112 is a novel immunogenic cell death (ICD)-inducing small molecule 
under Phase 2 development in several cancer types. It inhibits ribosome 
biogenesis and causes organelle stresses, leading to selective ICD in cancer 
cells. The possibility of PT-112's pyrophosphate moiety driving high drug 
concentrations to bone sites of disease led to an interest in PT-112 use in 
multiple myeloma. Here, we present findings from Phase I and in vivo studies for 
PT-112 in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PT-112 biodistribution was analyzed in mice via laser 
ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Activity of PT-112 was 
assessed in de novo and variant Vk*MYC multiple myeloma mouse models as 
monotherapy or combination therapies. M-spike levels and survival were measured. 
A Phase I dose escalation study of PT-112 monotherapy was conducted using 3+3 
design in heavily pretreated RRMM patients with exhausted available therapies.
RESULTS: In vivo biodistribution imaging revealed high concentrations in bone, 
kidney, lung, skin, and liver. PT-112 was active in Vk*MYC multiple myeloma 
mouse models, alone and in combination. Phase I data showed that PT-112 
monotherapy was safe and well-tolerated, establishing a recommended Phase 2 dose 
of 360 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Confirmed responses and 
other signals of activity were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a lack of cross-resistance with standard of 
care and support the translational value of the Vk*MYC model system. Further 
clinical investigation of PT-112 is warranted in multiple myeloma.

SCOPE: Vascular graft or endograft infection (VGEI) is a severe complication 
requiring a multidisciplinary approach combining surgery and antimicrobial 
therapy. This study aimed to develop expert consensus on the management and 
follow-up of VGEI, with a focus on antimicrobial strategies.
METHODS: A modified Delphi method was conducted to reach consensus on key 
aspects of VGEI care, including antimicrobial treatment, surgical management, 
and follow-up. An expert panel representing infectious diseases, vascular and 
cardiothoracic surgery, microbiology, and nuclear medicine participated in four 
rounds of surveys. Ten general and 35 specific statements were rated using a 
five-point Likert scale. Statements with ≥75% agreement (agree/strongly agree) 
were considered to have achieved consensus. Internal consistency across rounds 
was assessed using Cronbach's alpha (>0.80).
QUESTIONS ADDRESSED BY THE DELPHI METHOD AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The panel agreed 
that empirical antimicrobial therapy should be initiated only in patients with 
complications (e.g., sepsis, bleeding) or when diagnostic intervention is 
delayed. Empirical therapy must be individualized based on graft location and 
risk factors. For abdominal VGEI without aorto-enteric fistula and unknown 
pathogens, initial coverage should target Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative 
bacilli, and anaerobes, with consideration for MRSA/MRSE based on risk. For 
thoracic VGEI without fistula, Gram-positive coverage is prioritized, with 
optional MRSA coverage. Postoperative treatment duration should be 
individualized. In cases of complete graft removal and replacement with 
autologous veins, a 6-week antibiotic course is recommended, with early oral 
switch if bioavailable options are available. If prosthetic material remains, at 
least 4-6 weeks of intravenous therapy followed by oral treatment for a total of 
12 weeks is advised. Prolonged therapy should be considered in cases with 
virulent pathogens, incomplete source control, or persistent inflammatory 
markers. The study provides practical, expert-based antimicrobial guidance for 
VGEI management and emphasizes the importance of individualized, 
microbiologically informed therapy within a multidisciplinary care framework.

This study aimed to determine if extended infusion (EI; over > 3 hr) beta-lactam 
therapy increased IV access requirements compared with traditional dosing (TD; 
over 30 min). Eighty-six adult ICU patients treated with TD anti-pseudomonal 
beta-lactams who underwent therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) were included. 
Patients who transitioned from TD to EI after TDM (EI group) were matched 1:1 to 
patients who remained on TD. In the primary analysis, the median (interquartile 
range) total number of lumens in the 24 hours before TDM compared with the 48 
hours after TDM were similar between groups (pre: TD 3 [2-5] vs. EI 4 [3-5]; p = 
0.22 and post: TD 3 [2-4] vs. EI 4 [3-5]; p = 0.05). Delivery of beta-lactams 
via EI was not associated with a need for more IV access. Practical challenges 
such as access should not limit use of EI beta-lactams when indicated.

OBJECTIVE: We describe a phase II clinical trial evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of the oral CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in patients with recurrent 
ovarian cancer.
METHODS: Eligible patients with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST) and/or CA-125 measurable recurrent ovarian cancer were treated with 
oral palbociclib 125 mg daily for 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Patients with 
hormone receptor-positive tumors were allowed to concurrently receive an 
aromatase inhibitor. The primary endpoint was the biochemical response rate, 
determined by CA-125 response based on Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup criteria. 
Genomic analyses were performed using targeted next-generation sequencing.
RESULTS: The biochemical response rate among 40 patients was 8.3% (95% CI 2.2 to 
23.6), and the objective response rate by CA-125 criteria and/or RECIST was 
10.5% (95% CI 3.4 to 25.7). Median progression-free survival was 3.2 months. 
Progression-free survival rates at 6 and 12 months were 25% and 7.5%, 
respectively. Two patients diagnosed with recurrent low-grade serous ovarian 
cancer experienced long-term disease stabilization for more than 37 and 9 
months, triggering a review of 12 additional low-grade serous ovarian cancer 
patients treated outside of the phase II trial. Exploratory tumor genomic 
profiling revealed potential predictors of sensitivity (CDKN2A deletion) or 
resistance (CCNE1 amplification or RB1 deletion), which require additional 
independent validation.
CONCLUSIONS: Palbociclib demonstrated only modest clinical activity in 
unselected patients with ovarian cancer. However, cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 
inhibition showed promising clinical activity in low-grade serous ovarian 
cancer, warranting further study in this subtype. Further biomarker analyses may 
facilitate patient selection in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.

Background/Objectives: Traditional hearing aid noise reduction algorithms offer 
no additional benefit in noisy situations for bimodal cochlear implant (CI) 
users with a CI in one ear and a hearing aid (HA) in the other. Recent 
breakthroughs in deep neural network (DNN)-based noise reduction have improved 
speech understanding for hearing aid users in noisy environments. These 
advancements could also boost speech perception in noise for bimodal CI users. 
This study investigated the effectiveness of DNN-based noise reduction in the 
HAs used by bimodal CI patients. Methods: Eleven bimodal CI patients, aged 71-89 
years old, were fit with a Phonak Audéo Sphere Infinio 90 HA in their 
non-implanted ear and were provided with a Calm Situation program and Spheric 
Speech in Loud Noise program that uses DNN-based noise reduction. Sentence 
recognition scores were measured using AzBio sentences in quiet and in noise 
with the CI alone, hearing aid alone, and bimodally with both the Calm Situation 
and DNN HA programs. Results: The DNN program in the hearing aid significantly 
improved bimodal performance in noise, with sentence recognition scores reaching 
79% compared to 60% with Calm Situation (a 19% average benefit, p < 0.001). When 
compared to the CI-alone condition in multi-talker babble, the DNN HA program 
offered a 40% bimodal benefit, significantly higher than the 21% score seen with 
the Calm Situation program. Conclusions: DNN-based noise reduction in HA 
significantly improves speech understanding in noise for bimodal CI users. 
Utilization of this technology is a promising option to address patients' common 
complaint of speech understanding in noise.

CONTEXT: Side effects from tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are common and 
burdensome. Olanzapine is useful for managing symptoms from conventional 
chemotherapy, but its role in treating TKI-related side effects is unclear.
OBJECTIVES: Examine the efficacy of olanzapine for TKI-induced nausea, vomiting, 
anorexia, weight loss, and insomnia.
METHODS: All patients prescribed olanzapine with lenvatinib, cabozantinib, 
axitinib, or tivozanib at Mayo Clinic between January 2018 and June 2024 were 
assessed for inclusion. For baseline assessment, clinical notes documenting 
symptoms and indication(s) for starting olanzapine were reviewed. Notes and 
portal messages from the first three months after starting olanzapine were then 
evaluated for qualitative descriptions of change in symptom burden. Data were 
categorized as "improved," "worsened," "stable," or "missing data," with each 
symptom domain analyzed independently, when olanzapine was prescribed for 
multiple interrelated symptoms.
RESULTS: Sixty patients received olanzapine, most commonly 5 mg (n = 37, 61.7%) 
or 2.5 mg (n = 16, 26.6%). Indications included nausea without vomiting (n = 
35), anorexia (n = 25), nausea with vomiting (n = 16), weight loss (n = 16), and 
insomnia (n = 11). It was given for multiple symptoms in 32 patients. Within the 
first 3 months, 85% of patients had improvement in nausea without vomiting, 93% 
in nausea with vomiting, 74% in appetite, and 85% in sleep. Among 34 patients 
with weight loss prior to olanzapine, 50% gained weight (median: 6.1 kg), 26% 
stabilized (±1 kg), and 24% continued to lose weight. Only 4 patients 
discontinued olanzapine due to side effects.
CONCLUSION: Olanzapine appears effective in treating TKI-induced nausea, 
vomiting, anorexia, insomnia, and weight loss, warranting further investigation 
in prospective studies.

BackgroundThe MIVI Q aspiration catheters have been shown to achieve 
significantly greater flow rates than other intracranial aspiration catheters in 
vitro. We describe our initial real-world experience with the MIVI Q catheter in 
emergent acute ischemic stroke (AIS) caused by distal and medium vessel 
occlusions (DMVO).MethodsData was collated from a prospectively maintained 
database which included patients from October 2019 to December 2022. Occlusion 
demographics, thrombectomy technique, reperfusion scoring, procedural 
complications and disposition were assessed. The primary outcome of interest was 
rate of successful reperfusion defined as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 
(TICI) score 2b-3. Secondary outcomes included rate of first pass effect (FPE) 
and complications.ResultsWe included 64 target occlusions in 51 patients. The Q 
catheter successfully reached the DMVO in all occlusions. Successful reperfusion 
was achieved in 49/64 (76.6%) occlusions, and TICI scores were similar for 
primary and secondary DMVOs (P value = 0.41). FPE was achieved in 39/64 (60.9%) 
occlusions and did not differ between primary and secondary DMVOs (P 
value = 0.13). Reperfusion hemorrhage occurred in 3/64 (4.7%) cases, small 
volume subarachnoid hemorrhage in 3/64 (4.7%) cases, and small hemorrhagic 
transformation in 1/64 (1.6%) cases; the rate of complications did not differ 
based on primary versus secondary DMVO (P value = 0.29).ConclusionThe MIVI Q 
catheter is both safe and effective. Our real-world experience supports the 
superior flow rates demonstrated in vitro and translates into high rates of 
successful reperfusion in AIS caused by DMVO in clinical practice.

Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) is a leading cause of heart failure globally. 
Myocardial viability testing aims to identify dysfunctional but potentially 
reversible myocardium in patients with ICM. This review examines the clinical 
application and diagnostic performance of radionuclide imaging techniques 
including thallium-201 (201Tl) and technetium-99 m (99mTc) single positron 
emission tomography (SPECT), and flourine-18-flourodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) 
positron emission tomography (PET) for assessing myocardial viability. 201TI 
SPECT assesses viability via active myocardial uptake and delayed redistribution 
but is limited by prolonged protocols and suboptimal image quality. 
99mTc-labeled agents (sestamibi and tetrofosmin) offer improved spatial 
resolution, shorter half-life, and higher photon energy, enabling faster imaging 
and better image quality. When combined with nitrate augmentation or gated 
imaging, 99mTc SPECT enhances detection of viable but under perfused myocardium. 
18F-FDG PET is considered the gold standard modality for viability assessment 
due to its superior sensitivity, image quality and quantitative capabilities for 
myocardial blood flow. While observational studies associate viability with 
improved outcomes after revascularization, randomized trials have yielded mixed 
results. However, contemporary guidelines continue to support viability testing 
in selected high-risk patients. Emerging technologies including novel PET 
tracers, artificial intelligence, and hybrid imaging may further improve 
diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of radionuclide viability testing. 
Radionuclide imaging remains a valuable tool in assessing myocardial viability 
in ICM. While PET offers superior diagnostic accuracy, SPECT remains widely used 
given its accessibility. Future studies incorporating modern imaging 
technologies and contemporary heart failure therapies are needed to clarify the 
role of viability testing in guiding revascularization strategies.

OBJECTIVE: To examine: (1) the trajectory of caregiver resilience over 2 years 
after onset of a care-recipient's moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury 
(TBI), (2) caregiver-related outcomes associated with resilience, and (3) 
changes in associations between caregiver resilience, other caregiver 
characteristics, and care-recipient variables across time.
DESIGN: Prospective cohort.
SETTING: TBI Model System (TBIMS) centers.
PARTICIPANTS: TBIMS participants (care-recipients) were approached to enroll in 
this study and identify a caregiver. Two hundred fifty-eight (N=258) 
care-recipient and caregiver dyads were enrolled.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Caregiver data included demographics, health history, 
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Zarit 
Burden Interview (ZBI), Family Needs Questionnaire-Revised, and Connor-Davidson 
Resilience Scale 10 (CD-RISC-10). All caregiver data were self-reported via 
phone interview or mailed surveys at 6, 12, and 24 months after injury. At all 3 
timepoints, care-recipients with TBI also completed their own CD-RISC-10, PHQ-9, 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and Disability Rating Scale.
RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models indicated that the trajectory of resilience 
was stable within caregivers over 2 years after injury. There were significant, 
positive associations for all caregiver Family Needs Questionnaire-Revised 
subscales (all P<.001) with care-recipient and caregiver CD-RISC-10 scores 
(P=.001), indicating that more caregiving needs endorsed as "met" corresponded 
with higher resilience. Caregiver PHQ-9 and ZBI scores were found to be 
negatively associated with resilience (both P<.001). When all covariates were 
included in the multivariable model, met emotional needs was positively 
associated with caregiver resilience (P<.0001). Negative associations with 
caregiver resilience included higher caregiver PHQ-9 scores (P=.001) and 
perceptions of caregiving burden (P=.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Caregiver levels of resilience were generally stable over 2 years 
post-TBI. Caregivers' resilience was positively associated with perceptions of 
their needs being met and negatively associated with caregiving burden and 
emotional distress. Further research is needed to develop and evaluate the 
utility and feasibility of interventions to enhance resilience, meet family 
needs, and improve long-term outcomes after brain injury.

BACKGROUND: Surgical techniques for biceps tenodesis vary in approach, fixation 
strategy, and anatomic location without a clear superior technique for this 
common procedure. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate a 
randomized cohort of patients who underwent arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps 
tenodesis (ASBT) with interference screw fixation using an inlay technique vs. 
mini-open subpectoral biceps tenodesis (MOBT) with a unicortical button implant 
using an onlay technique with regard to (1) clinical outcome measures and (2) 
structural healing as evaluated by ultrasound.
METHODS: From May 2017 to April 2021, patients who had undergone biceps 
tenodesis were preoperatively randomized to either ASBT or MOBT. American 
Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and visual 
analog scale scores were recorded at baseline, 3 months, and 2 years 
postoperatively. The integrity of the biceps tendon at the tenodesis site was 
independently examined via ultrasound by a musculoskeletal-trained radiologist 
at 3 months and 2 years postoperatively. t tests were performed for continuous 
variables, whereas χ2 tests were performed for categorical variables.
RESULTS: A total of 52 patients (24 ASBT and 28 MOBT) were randomized and 
completed follow-up. At baseline, 3 months, and 2 years postoperatively, the 
mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, 
and Visual Analog Scale scores were not statistically different between ASBT and 
MOBT. At the 3-month postoperative ultrasound, 23 of 24 (96%) ASBT patients and 
26 of 28 (93%) MOBT patients were noted to have a clearly intact biceps 
tenodesis. At 2 years, all biceps tenodeses regardless of group were noted to be 
intact and healed, including all 3 shoulders whose ultrasound noted a 
questionably intact repair without significant retraction of the tendon at 
previous 3-month ultrasound evaluation.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates similar clinical outcomes at 2-year 
follow-up between ASBT and MOBT. Both groups demonstrated improvement that 
exceeded the reported patient acceptable symptom state and minimal clinically 
important difference. Ultrasound showed excellent structural healing rates for 
both inlay and onlay biceps tenodesis techniques.

INTRODUCTION: Monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) is increasingly 
recognized as an important cause of kidney failure. A kidney biopsy remains an 
important diagnostic measure. However, a kidney biopsy is not without risks. 
Here, we devised the Mayo MGRS Prediction Tool to assess the probability of 
finding MGRS in patients with chronic kidney disease with monoclonal gammopathy 
(MG).
METHODS: We included patients from 2013 to October 2023 who underwent a kidney 
biopsy at the Mayo Clinic excluding those whose hematological condition required 
specific treatment due to tumor burden such as multiple myeloma.
RESULTS: Of 280 patients, 92 (32.9%) had MGRS lesions with amyloid light chain 
or primary amyloidosis being the most common lesion in 38 patients (41.3%). We 
performed multivariable logistic regression with forward variable selection to 
fit the model. The final model included eight predictors: diabetes, 
affected/unaffected free light chain ratio, urinary protein (g/24 hours), 
positive urine protein electrophoresis or immunofixation electrophoresis, serum 
creatinine, C3 level (mg/dL), hematuria, and systolic blood pressure. The 
calculated and optimism-corrected area under the curve was 0.896 and 0.836, 
respectively. The decision curve analysis showed that the model provided net 
benefit across all thresholds. A threshold probability of 0.10 was 98.9% 
sensitive and 50.5% specific, and a threshold probability of 0.25 was 88.0% 
sensitive and 70.2% specific. The model was validated using an external cohort 
of 109 patients from the University of Minnesota with good performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Our Mayo MGRS Prediction Tool is useful in assisting clinicians in 
predicting the probability of finding an MGRS lesion in a kidney biopsy.

Testosterone for the Treatment of Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder in 
Perimenopausal and Postmenopausal Women.

Arizona; and the Mayo Clinic Center for Women's Health, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, 
Minnesota.

Although there is no androgen deficiency diagnosis for women, research 
demonstrates that testosterone treatment can be modestly beneficial in treating 
appropriately selected postmenopausal women with distressing low desire, also 
known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). Current data do not support 
the role of testosterone treatment in supporting bone health or brain health or 
improving energy or cognition in women, and only limited research supports its 
benefit for HSDD treatment in women of late reproductive age. No current U.S. 
Federal Drug Administration-approved formulation of testosterone is available 
for women in the United States because of a lack of long-term safety data. 
However, two clinical guidelines now provide expert guidance on testosterone 
treatment and monitoring in women for HSDD. This narrative review presents the 
data and summarizes the guidelines in a clinically relevant format to make the 
information accessible to clinicians treating cisgender women with HSDD seeking 
testosterone treatment.

Mucosal homeostasis requires coordinated immune regulation and epithelial 
repair. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) arises from disrupted coordination 
between the immune system and intestinal epithelium, where resolution and repair 
must occur in parallel. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a dual role: it promotes 
epithelial regeneration but destabilizes regulatory T cells (Tregs). We aimed to 
determine the contribution of Treg IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) signaling to intestinal 
inflammation and epithelial integrity. We developed a conditional knockout mouse 
model in which IL-6R was deleted from Tregs (Treg IL-6R knockout). These mice 
were subjected to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis and a T cell 
transfer model of colitis. Soluble IL-6R production by Tregs was assessed in 
vitro, and transcriptional changes in epithelial cells were analyzed by RNA-seq. 
Human colonic organoids from IBD patients were treated with IL-6 or hyper-IL-6 
(IL-6/sIL-6R fusion protein) to test downstream signaling effects. Tregs lacking 
IL-6R improved colitis to a similar extent as control Tregs in the adoptive 
transfer model, indicating intact suppressive function. However, Treg IL-6R 
knockout mice were more susceptible to DSS colitis than controls, suggesting a 
physiologic role for Treg IL-6R signaling in epithelial protection. In vitro, 
Tregs shed soluble IL-6R, enabling IL-6 trans-signaling to epithelial cells. 
Intestinal epithelial cells from Treg IL-6R knockout mice compared to WTcre 
controls revealed widespread transcriptional downregulation of genes related to 
survival and repair pathways at baseline, and impaired transcriptional responses 
following DSS treatment. In human organoids, IL-6 trans-signaling elicited 
stronger STAT3 activation than IL-6 alone. These findings reveal a previously 
unrecognized role for Treg-derived IL-6R in promoting epithelial resilience and 
maintaining mucosal homeostasis.

The roles of nucleoplasmic-residing nucleoporins (NUPs) in solid tumors, 
including prostate cancer, remain unknown. In this study, we reveal the clinical 
significance and mechanistic role of the off-pore NUP, soluble POM121 (sPOM121), 
as a crucial transcriptional regulator that enhances the aggressiveness of 
metastatic prostate cancer. Using orthogonal methodologies in human samples, 
sPOM121 was identified as the predominantly expressed nucleoplasmic NUP in 
prostate cancer. Unbiased proteomic and epigenomic studies demonstrate that 
sPOM121, through its C-terminus, interacts with the chromatin remodeler SMARCA5 
at gene promoter sites and localizes at nuclear condensates, reprogramming gene 
expression. Indeed, sPOM121 regulates a distinct oncogenic gene network, 
including β-catenin, leading to prostate cancer progression and immune evasion. 
Importantly, targeting the sPOM121/β-catenin axis in patient-derived 
pre-clinical and syngeneic mouse models halts prostate cancer aggressiveness and 
enhances anti-tumor immunity. Taken together, these findings reveal previously 
unknown actionable reprogramming functions of off-pore NUPs in solid tumors.

haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, accompanied by the expansion of 
high-fitness clones over time. Age-related clonal haematopoiesis arises from 
ageing-related DNA damage and is associated with haematological neoplasms and 
coronary artery disease. Genotoxic therapies can promote the selection of 
somatic mutations, leading to therapy-related clonal haematopoiesis. Clonal 
haematopoiesis in acquired or inherited bone marrow failure syndromes and 
germline predispositions leads to clonal expansion, where fitness constraints on 
haematopoietic stem cells drive mutation acquisition. When clonal haematopoiesis 
occurs in the context of persistent unexplained cytopenias, with somatic 
mutations driving haematopoietic dysfunction, it is referred to as clonal 
cytopenias of undetermined significance (CCUS). CCUS is a precursor to myeloid 
neoplasms, with variable progression rates. In this Review, we summarise the 
current state of knowledge, offering critical insights into the molecular 
evolution of, and diagnostics and risk assessment for clonal haematopoiesis and 
CCUS. We highlight the interplay between ageing and environmental factors in the 
progression to haematological neoplasms and discuss challenges for risk 
stratification and disease monitoring.

INTRODUCTION: Initiation of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) for the management 
of venous thromboembolism (VTE) typically includes a lead-in dosing phase. 
However, some patients may receive a shortened course due to comorbid conditions 
and/or numerous days of parenteral therapy. Limited data exist on the outcomes 
of an abbreviated lead-in therapy regimen.
AIM: To investigate the clinical outcomes of patients receiving abbreviated 
versus standard/non-abbreviated DOAC lead-in regimens following parenteral 
anticoagulation therapy for VTE.
METHOD: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including adults (≥ 18 years 
of age) who were admitted for acute VTE between 04/01/2019 and 12/31/2023 and 
received ≥ 24 h of parenteral anticoagulation before being transitioned to a 
DOAC with abbreviated versus non-abbreviated DOAC lead-in dose. The primary 
outcome was death or readmission from a thrombotic event within 30 days of 
discharge. Data were presented using descriptive statistics, logistic 
regression, and time-to-event analysis.
RESULTS: Across 590 patients, the median (IQR) age was 67 (58-76) years and 280 
(47.5%) were female. Over half had a pulmonary embolism (54.9%; N = 324), 21.0% 
(N = 124) had a deep vein thrombosis, and the remainder experienced a 
combination. Most patients received the non-abbreviated lead-in dose (83.2%; 
N = 491). When compared to the non-abbreviated cohort, a higher proportion of 
those who received an abbreviated lead-in therapy had prior VTE and heart 
failure. There were no significant associations between an abbreviated lead-in 
dose and the primary outcome (aOR 0.44; 95% CI 0.13-1.52; P = 0.20). Bleeding 
events were also similar between the abbreviated and non-abbreviated dose 
cohorts at the longest follow-up (3.0%, N = 3 vs. 2.9%, N = 14; P = 0.92; aOR 
0.82; 95% CI 0.22-3.1; P = 0.77) and within 30 days of DOAC initiation (HR 1.24; 
95% CI 0.26-5.82; P = 0.79).
CONCLUSION: An abbreviated DOAC lead-in therapy was not associated with 
short-term mortality, readmission due to recurrent thrombosis, or bleeding. 
Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and provide 
insights into more personalized regimens.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the impact of the grade and jet direction of residual 
aortic regurgitation (rAR) after valve-sparing root replacement (VSRR).
METHODS: The study enrolled 248 adult patients who underwent VSRR between 1995 
and 2021. The patients were divided into groups based on the postoperative rAR. 
Patients with rAR were further categorized according to rAR grade and jet 
direction. The primary endpoint was the development of aortic regurgitation of 
moderate or greater (≥moderate) severity and/or the need for valve replacement 
during the follow-up, analyzed by a multivariable competing risk analysis. The 
secondary endpoints included the occurrence of rAR and overall survival.
RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 36.5 years, and 79.8% had been 
diagnosed with connective tissue disease. After VSRR, 146 patients did not 
present with rAR; however, 102 had rAR (77 with minimal central, 18 with minimal 
eccentric, and 7 with mild rAR). The 5-year and 8-year incidence rates of the 
primary endpoint were 14.6% and 17.9%, respectively. rAR was a significant risk 
factor (P = .001), and eccentricity and mild rAR seemed to have important roles. 
The risk factors for rAR included dilated root, preoperative moderate 
regurgitation, and redo sternotomy. Overall survival was influenced only by age.
CONCLUSIONS: rAR after VSRR operation could be a risk factor for AR progression. 
Minimal central rAR generally has a tolerable clinical course; however, patients 
with even minimal eccentric AR may develop AR progression, so active 
surveillance and timely management might be required. Furthermore, early VSRR 
can help reduce the rAR.

Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.

OBJECTIVE: To derive precise estimates of anxiety and depressive disorder 
prevalence in patients with common vestibular disorders.
DATA SOURCES: CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PubMed, PsycINFO, and SCOPUS.
REVIEW METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was reported per PRISMA 
guidelines. Outcomes included continuous measures (mean), proportions (%), and 
relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS: Eighty-five studies (n = 764,403) examining anxiety, depression, and 
vestibular disorders in adults were included. Mean ages were 50.3 (vestibular) 
and 46.7 (control); females comprised 63.8% and 64.3%, respectively. Patients 
with vestibular disorders had significantly higher rates and risks of anxiety 
(31.4% vs. 8.3%, p < 0.0001; RR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0) and depression (28.3% 
vs. 4.7%, p < 0.0001; RR = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.8-4.4) than controls. Elevated rates 
were observed in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (30.6%, 23.6%), Meniere's 
disease (47.0%, 43.1%), vestibular migraine (46.5%, 35.7%), and vestibular 
neuritis (19.4%, 20.7%) (all p < 0.0001). Episodic disorders showed higher 
prevalence than vestibular neuritis. Patients with unspecified peripheral 
vestibular disorders also had significantly higher anxiety (12.1%) and 
depression (13.2%) rates than controls. Meta-regression revealed significant 
associations between Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) scores and Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) anxiety and depression subscales.
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis offers the most precise prevalence and relative 
risk estimates of anxiety and depressive disorders in vestibular illness. The 
greater risk in episodic versus single-event vestibular disorders may inform the 
understanding of vestibular-psychiatric comorbidity mechanisms.

Decision-Making in Transplant Candidate Selection Committees: Frameworks and 
Other Considerations.

Organ transplant selection committees are tasked with deciding whether patients 
seeking a transplant are medically and psychosocially appropriate to be placed 
on the waitlist. The selection process is obscure to patients and those outside 
of the institution. Currently, very limited standards exist for decision-making 
in selection committees, which could exacerbate inequities and disparities in 
the transplant process, a major concern among patients. Additionally, limited 
literature exists regarding decision-making in recipient selection committees. 
Evaluation of different decision-making frameworks and their factors may inform 
how current recipient selection committees should operate. There is no dearth of 
frameworks described for decision-making. The four group decision-making 
frameworks - autocratic, minority-control, majority-control, and consensus-based 
- were chosen for their ability to best represent different factors as they 
specifically relate to the transplant recipient selection process and were 
vetted against many other frameworks which were either deemed not applicable to 
transplant decision or not representative of the challenges faced in recipient 
selection. From the literature, we identified six themes that selection 
committees should be cognizant of during decision-making: reducing bias, 
balancing efficiency, confronting hierarchical structure, preventing groupthink, 
preventing group polarization, and using advocates and dissenters. These factors 
contribute to suboptimal outcomes and can be mitigated through a variety of 
factors. By creating uniform standards and policies and articulating them, 
increasing transparency of the decision-making processes in transplant 
selection, we may achieve more public trust in the system and more equity in the 
care of our patients.

OBJECTIVE: To prospectively describe the degree of blepharoptosis among patients 
who underwent plaque radiotherapy.
DESIGN: A single-center prospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients who underwent plaque radiotherapy at a single center.
METHODS: Margin reflex distance 1 (MRD1), palpebral fissure height, eyelid 
excursion, and exophthalmometry measurements were taken before and after 
surgery. To determine the impact of surgical manipulation versus radiation 
exposure, measurements were compared to a separate cohort of 28 patients who 
underwent filtering glaucoma surgery.
RESULTS: There were 24 patients treated with plaque radiotherapy in the study, 
with a mean age of 61 years at presentation and 70.8% male sex. In involved 
eyes, mean palpebral fissure height decreased from 8.38 mm preoperatively to 
7.25 mm postoperatively (p < 0.01) and mean MRD1 decreased from 3.46 mm to 2.29 
mm (p < 0.01). Frequency of ptosis increased from 20.8% preoperatively to 62.5% 
postoperatively. In a similarly aged cohort of patients undergoing glaucoma 
filtering surgery, the frequency of ptosis also increased from 32.1% 
preoperatively to 64.3% postoperatively. The frequency was not different between 
the plaque and glaucoma groups preoperatively (p = 0.359) or postoperatively (p 
= 0.894). The degree of ptosis in patients who underwent plaque radiotherapy was 
similar to patients who underwent glaucoma surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Blepharoptosis is a frequent side effect of plaque radiotherapy, 
with more than half of patients affected after surgery. When compared to similar 
surgical manipulation for filtering glaucoma surgery, radiation did not appear 
to be associated with more frequent blepharoptosis. Patients should be advised 
that blepharoptosis can be a side effect following plaque radiotherapy.

control.

Neural drive to the diaphragm muscle (DIAm) for breathing is generated in the 
medulla and descends primarily ipsilaterally to phrenic motor neurons (PhMNs) in 
the cervical spinal cord. Neuromotor control of the DIAm during breathing 
involves motor unit (MU) recruitment, sustained activity, and derecruitment, 
which may be differentially altered on ipsilateral and contralateral sides after 
C2 spinal hemisection (C2SH). In awake rats, bilateral DIAm electromyographic 
(EMG) activity was recorded via chronically implanted electrodes during eupnea 
in nine Sprague-Dawley rats before and 14 days (day 14) after C2SH. The 
durations of MU recruitment and derecruitment were estimated by evaluating EMG 
signal stationarity, i.e., changes in the mean square average of onset- and 
offset-aligned 10-ms bins within a longer (e.g., 80 ms) sampling period reflect 
changes in EMG due to MU recruitment. The amplitudes of DIAm EMG at the end of 
the recruitment and beginning of the derecruitment phase were measured. On the 
ipsilateral side, C2SH decreased DIAm EMG recruitment amplitude by ∼30% and peak 
amplitude by ∼35% by day 14, likely reflecting a decrease in the number of MUs 
recruited. On the contralateral side, C2SH increased recruitment amplitude by 
∼70% and peak amplitude by ∼80% by day 14, likely reflecting an increase in the 
number of MUs recruited. The derecruitment amplitude decreased ipsilaterally and 
increased contralaterally, consistent with the recruitment of higher threshold 
MUs contralaterally. The present study reveals that the impact of C2SH on 
ipsilateral and contralateral DIAm neuromotor control varies depending on the 
loss of ipsilateral neural drive.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neuromotor control of the 
diaphragm muscle (DIAm) after C2 spinal hemisection (C2SH) is impacted 
differentially between ipsilateral and contralateral sides. We show neural drive 
to ipsilateral phrenic motor neurons decreases after C2SH, leading to a 
reduction in the number of DIAm motor units (MUs) recruited. Contralateral 
neural drive increases after C2SH, leading to an increase in the number of MU 
recruited. These results provide novel information about the impact of C2SH on 
DIAm neuromotor control.

Data binary encoding has proven to be a versatile tool for optimizing data 
processing and memory efficiency in various machine learning applications. This 
includes deep barcoding, generating barcodes from deep learning feature 
extraction for image retrieval of similar cases among millions of indexed 
images. Despite the recent advancement in barcode generation methods, converting 
high-dimensional feature vectors (e.g., deep features) to compact and 
discriminative binary barcodes is still an urgent necessity and remains an 
unresolved problem. Difference-based binarization of features is one of the most 
efficient binarization methods, transforming continuous feature vectors into 
binary sequences and capturing trend information. However, the performance of 
this method is highly dependent on the ordering of the input features, leading 
to a significant combinatorial challenge. This research addresses this problem 
by optimizing feature sequences based on retrieval performance metrics. Our 
approach identifies optimal feature orderings, leading to substantial 
improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to arbitrary or default 
orderings. We assess the performance of the proposed approach in various medical 
and non-medical image retrieval tasks. This evaluation includes medical images 
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a comprehensive publicly available dataset, 
as well as COVID-19 Chest X-rays dataset. In addition, we evaluate the proposed 
approach on non-medical benchmark image datasets, such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, 
and Fashion-MNIST. Our findings demonstrate the importance of optimizing binary 
barcode representation to significantly enhance accuracy for fast image 
retrieval across a wide range of applications, highlighting the applicability 
and potential of barcodes in various domains.

Generative artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in 
medical imaging since 2022, enabling the creation of derivative synthetic 
datasets that closely resemble real-world data. This Viewpoint examines key 
aspects of synthetic data, focusing on its advancements, applications, and 
challenges in medical imaging. Various generative artificial intelligence image 
generation paradigms, such as physics-informed and statistical models, and their 
potential to augment and diversify medical research resources are explored. The 
promises of synthetic datasets, including increased diversity, privacy 
preservation, and multifunctionality, are also discussed, along with their 
ability to model complex biological phenomena. Next, specific applications using 
synthetic data such as enhancing medical education, augmenting rare disease 
datasets, improving radiology workflows, and enabling privacy-preserving 
multicentre collaborations are highlighted. The challenges and ethical 
considerations surrounding generative artificial intelligence, including patient 
privacy, data copying, and potential biases that could impede clinical 
translation, are also addressed. Finally, future directions for research and 
development in this rapidly evolving field are outlined, emphasising the need 
for robust evaluation frameworks and responsible utilisation of generative 
artificial intelligence in medical imaging.

Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR T-cell) is a new treatment option 
for relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Novel 
therapies including Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTK), covalent or 
noncovalent, and an inhibitor of the B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (BCL-2), 
venetoclax, have replaced chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) regimens in the front-line 
and the R/R setting, and have relegated allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (allo-HCT) to later treatment stages. Updating the 2016 clinical 
practice recommendations on allo-HCT in CLL is necessary to help guide 
contemporary clinical practice. A panel of 18 physicians with diverse expertise 
across different CLL treatment modalities and one methodologist participated in 
this effort. Any recommendation receiving ≥ 70% votes was considered a 
consensus. CAR T-cell therapy is recommended for patients not responding or 
relapsing after at least 2 lines of therapy consisting of a covalent BTK 
inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. In addition, CAR T-cell therapy is recommended 
for patients who subsequently received a noncovalent BTK inhibitor in the 
third-line or later setting, regardless of response. CAR T-cell therapy is also 
recommended in CLL relapsing after an allo-HCT, assuming that patients are fit 
for the procedure. In those CLL patients who are candidates, allo-HCT is 
recommended if disease is R/R to CAR T-cell therapy provided that an objective 
response is demonstrated prior to the allograft. Allo-HCT is also recommended in 
patients with clonally-related Richter transformation (RT) after demonstrating 
an objective response to front-line CIT or other treatments. CAR T-cell therapy 
is recommended in R/R RT. We emphasize the importance of enrolling patients in 
clinical trials whenever available to continue to advance the field and improve 
prognosis of R/R CLL. We acknowledge that there are unique clinical scenarios 
not covered herein which may require a case-by-case approach.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most aggressive forms of 
pancreatic cancer, is associated with poor survival outcomes and currently ranks 
as the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Despite 
its clinical significance, PDAC development and progression mechanisms remain in 
part poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence of a novel role for Sorting 
nexin 10 (SNX10), a member of the sorting nexin family, in the regulation of 
KRAS-induced pancreatic carcinogenesis. We demonstrate that SNX10 is 
downregulated in PDAC, especially in advanced cases. Further, mutational 
analysis revealed SNX10 genetic alterations in PDAC cases. Functional studies 
demonstrated that SNX10 overexpression in human PDAC cells inhibited cell 
proliferation and colony formation. Moreover, SNX10 overexpression induced 
G1-phase cell cycle arrest and decreased KRAS signaling activity. Using a novel 
Snx10 knockout mouse crossed with a Kras-driven PDAC model, we observed reduced 
survival, increased tumor cell proliferation, enhanced aggression, and 
heightened inflammation. Collectively, these findings highlight SNX10 as a tumor 
suppressor candidate in PDAC and underscore its promise as a foundation for new 
therapeutic approaches.

IMPORTANCE: Diagnostic errors represent a major patient safety concern, with the 
potential to significantly impact patient outcomes. To address this, various 
trigger-based strategies have been developed to identify diagnostic errors, 
aiming to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient safety.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of three pre-established triggers (T) in 
the emergency department (ED) setting and assess their effectiveness in 
detecting diagnostic errors.
DESIGN: Consecutive cohort, retrospective observational design.
SETTING: Academic ED with 80 000 annual visits.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults and children presenting to a single ED in the USA between 1 
May 2018 and 1 January 2020.
INTERVENTION/OUTCOMES: Electronic health records (EHRs) were retrieved and 
categorised into trigger-positive and trigger-negative cases using the following 
criteria: T1-unscheduled returnvisits to the ED with admission within 7-10 days 
of theinitial visit; T2-care escalation from the inpatient unitto the intensive 
care unit (ICU) within 6, 12 or 24 hoursof ED admission; and T3-all deaths in 
the ED or within24 hours of ED admission, excluding palliative care. A random 
sample of trigger-positive cases was reviewed using the SaferDx tool to 
determine the presence or absence of a diagnostic error.
RESULTS: A total of 5791 trigger-positive and 118262 trigger-negative cases were 
identified. Among trigger-positive cases, 4159 (72%) were associated with T1, 
1415 (24%) with T2, and 217 (4%) with T3. A preliminary chart review of 462 
trigger-positive and 251 trigger-negative cases showed most were error-negative 
(279 and 217, respectively). Detailed reviews found 32 diagnostic errors among 
183 trigger-positive cases, yielding PPVs of 5.4% (T1), 8.9% (T2), and 6.9% 
(T3). No errors were found in 34 reviewed trigger-negative cases, resulting in a 
100% NPV. Sepsis was the most common diagnosis among error-positive cases (n=11, 
34.4%). Those with non-specific chief complaints like altered mental status or 
shortness of breath had higher diagnostic error risk.
CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: While previously proposed EHR-based triggers can 
identify some diagnostic errors, they are insufficient for detecting all cases. 
To improve error detection performance, we recommend exploring data-driven 
strategies, such as machine learning techniques, to more effectively identify 
underlying contributing factors to diagnostic errors and enhance detection 
accuracy in the ED.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic performance of hysteroscopy-guided versus 
blind sampling in detecting concurrent endometrial carcinoma in patients with 
endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN) and to identify factors associated 
with missing cancer diagnosis.
DESIGN: This is a retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Integrated academic and community healthcare system in Minnesota and 
Wisconsin, USA, January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2023.
PARTICIPANTS: This included 151 patients diagnosed with EIN during endometrial 
sampling who underwent a hysterectomy within 3 months. Patients with concurrent 
cancer diagnoses were excluded.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients diagnosed with EIN using hysteroscopy-directed biopsy 
were compared to those diagnosed with blind-sampling methods using the pathology 
results of the subsequent hysterectomy specimen as the gold standard comparator 
to analyze rates of missed endometrial cancer (EC) diagnosis.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was a reduced risk of 
unanticipated concurrent EC on the final hysterectomy pathology result for 
patients diagnosed with endometrial intraepithelial hyperplasia via a 
hysteroscopy-directed biopsy (odds ratios [OR] = 0.44, 95% confidence intervals 
[CI] = 0.20-0.95, p = .033). In multivariate analysis, body mass index ≥30 and 
patient age >60 were associated with an elevated risk of EC on final pathology 
(OR = 4.17, 95% CI = 1.51-11.51, p = .004; OR = 5.56, 95% CI = 1.22-35.21, p < 
.001), respectively, and diabetes mellitus was the only independent variable 
associated with a higher risk of EIN on final hysterectomy pathology (OR = 7.01, 
95% CI = 1.40-35.04, p = .018). Age, body mass index, and endometrial thickness 
on pre-biopsy ultrasound were not associated with an increased risk of 
overlooking concurrent endometrial carcinoma on final hysterectomy pathology on 
univariate and multivariate analyses.
CONCLUSION: Hysteroscopy-directed biopsy may reduce the risk of missing a 
concurrent endometrial malignancy during endometrial sampling in women with EIN. 
The results affirm the superior diagnostic accuracy of hysteroscopy-directed 
endometrial evaluation.

The present study explores the noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging for the detection of GSK-3β overexpression using [18F]F-CNPI and 
[18F]F-CNBI in a GSK-3β overexpressing transgenic mouse model. Herein, we 
validated GSK-3β overexpression in different brain regions by genotyping and 
Western blot. PET scans and ex vivo biodistribution were performed in normal 
mice and early stage and late-stage GSK-3β transgenic mice with and without the 
P-gp inhibitor, Tariquidar. Both probes are found in the substrate of the P-gp 
transporter. [18F]F-CNPI showed significantly higher brain uptake in normal and 
GSK-3β overexpressing mice with the P-gp inhibitor compared to those without the 
P-gp inhibitor. The uptake of [18F]F-CNBI was lower in all the groups compared 
to that of [18F]F-CNPI. The late-stage GSK-3β transgenic mice having higher 
GSK-3β expression showed higher uptake of [18F]F-CNPI in the brain as compared 
to normal and early stage GSK-3β transgenic mice brains. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first report evaluating any GSK-3 PET probe in a GSK-3β 
overexpressing transgenic mouse model. The developed GSK-3β overexpressing 
transgenic mouse model can be efficiently employed to evaluate an array of GSK-3 
PET probes.

Acute Myocarditis (AM) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations 
and causes. Despite the recent advances in cardiovascular imaging, pathology, 
virology, and genetics, specific therapies are still lacking. This collaborative 
review aims to analyse the current evidence to answer practical questions that 
physicians may face during the early management of patients presenting with an 
acute form of the disease, complicated or not. This review analyses current 
evidence to address practical questions posed by acute cardiovascular physicians 
during the early management of acute, or potentially, myocarditis. Based on the 
current literature, this review provides a step-by-step approach to treat AM 
patients from their admission in the cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) to 
discharge, by answering 10 clinical questions: Might this patient be suffering 
from an AM? Should I hospitalize this patient and, if so, where? Which cardiac 
imaging exam should I perform and what can I learn from it? Is this patient 
requiring an EMB? What should the non-invasive aetiological work-up be? Is 
her/his episode of AM of viral, toxic, or other origin? Does this patient need 
specific treatments or mechanical circulatory support? Is there an indication 
for guideline-directed medical heart failure treatment? When can the patient be 
discharged and resume physical activity? Notably, this review highlights the 
need to build a multidisciplinary response team to address the many diagnostic 
and therapeutic challenges of AM patients. It also points out the lack of 
evidence to guide the treatment of these patients.

PURPOSE: To investigate the diurnal variations of episcleral venous pressure 
(EVP) and its relationships with IOP, blood pressure, and heart rate in healthy 
and systemic hypertension subjects.
METHODS: Twenty healthy adults and eight patients taking systemic 
antihypertensive medications were enrolled. IOP and EVP of both eyes, systolic 
and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and heart rate (HR), were measured 
at five time points, every two hours from 8 AM to 4 PM. IOP was measured by 
pneumatonometry, and EVP was assessed using a computer-controlled episcleral 
venomanometer with video recording and image processing. Changes in measurements 
at each time point were compared with baseline (8 AM) by using generalized 
estimating equation models. Correlations between EVP and other variables were 
determined using linear regression analysis.
RESULTS: EVP and IOP were highest in the early morning (8 AM) and lowest in the 
late afternoon (4 PM), with statistically significant changes (P < 0.05) across 
all time points compared to baseline in normotensive subjects. Changes in EVP 
and IOP were correlated at all time points. In treated systemic hypertensive 
subjects, similar trends were observed, with significant IOP and EVP 
correlations at multiple time points. No clear pattern of correlation was noted 
between EVP, SBP, DBP, and HR in all subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: IOP and EVP follow a diurnal rhythm with the highest values in the 
early morning, which gradually decrease throughout the day. The relationship 
between IOP and EVP suggests that reduction of EVP can be an important target 
for clinical regulation and stability of IOP.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and 
distress between sexually active midlife women (50-64 y) and older women (65+ y) 
presenting for care at women's health clinics at a tertiary care center.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included women aged 50 and above who 
received care at Mayo Clinic women's health clinics in Rochester, MN; 
Scottsdale, AZ; and Jacksonville, FL, between May 1, 2015, and August 31, 2022. 
Sexual function and distress were compared between midlife and older women using 
the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised 
(FSDS-R), and self-reported sexual health concerns.
RESULTS: Among 3,465 sexually active women, older women were less likely to 
report loss of sexual desire (33.4% vs. 47.6%; P<0.001) and reduced genital 
sensation (13.0% vs. 16.9%; P=0.024) compared with midlife women. There were no 
significant differences for vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, or 
arousal/orgasm difficulties. FSFI scores were higher in older women for desire 
(3.0 vs. 2.4; P<0.001) and lubrication (3.9 vs. 3.6; P<0.001). While total FSFI 
scores were similar between older and midlife women (21.2 vs. 22.2; P=0.11), 
sexually related distress was lower in older women compared with midlife women 
(13.0 vs. 15.0; P=0.015). The prevalence of FSD (defined as FSFI score ≤26.55 
and FSDS-R score ≥11) was similar between groups (51.8% vs. 56.2%; P=0.056).
CONCLUSIONS: Older women experienced FSD at similar rates as midlife women but 
reported less sexual distress, potentially reflecting lower expectations 
regarding sexual function. Addressing sexual health concerns in older women may 
enhance quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Revision of a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass 
(RYGB) is indicated for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and for weight 
recurrence. Existing literature is conflicting and lacks long-term follow-up.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the resolution of GERD and additional weight loss after 
conversion of SG to RYGB.
SETTING: Retrospective study of prospectively maintained multicentric bariatric 
surgery data sets.
METHODS: Patients who underwent a conversion from SG to RYGB were divided in two 
groups based on the indication (GERD versus weight). Outcomes included total 
weight loss (TWL), GERD symptoms resolution, nutritional parameters, and 
postoperative complications such as reoperations and readmissions. The outcomes 
were compared between both groups.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-four patients with GERD versus 93 weight patients 
were included in the study. At the time of the revision, the weight group had a 
significantly higher body mass index (BMI) (42.3 ± 5.5 versus 34.7 ± 6.6kg/m2, P 
< .0001). Both groups achieved comparable TWL following the revision (GERD:13 ± 
8% versus weight 16 ± 7%, P = .529; 23/93 lost to follow-up in the weight 
group). At the 1-year follow-up, more than 75% of the patients had their GERD 
symptoms resolved (18/124 lost to follow-up). For postoperative outcomes, 
immediate postoperative complications were comparable between both groups (P = 
.754). Over an average follow-up period of 4 years following the revision, 
patients with GERD had more late reoperations (GERD: 14% versus weight: 4%, P = 
.016).
CONCLUSIONS: SG-to-RYGB conversion for GERD or weight recurrence helped achieve 
resolution of GERD symptoms as well as additional weight loss. GERD patients 
suffered from worse clinical outcomes following a revision RYGB in comparison to 
the weight recurrence patients.

OBJECTIVES: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous product derived from 
whole blood through the process of gradient density centrifugation. Autologous 
PRP has been shown to be safe and effective in promoting natural wound healing 
processes. This study assessed the efficacy of fat graft myringoplasty combined 
with PRP in tympanic membrane (TM) healing in dry TM perforation due to chronic 
otitis media and compared it to that of fat graft myringoplasty.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective or retrospective 
studies was conducted, with database searches performed through April 2025. The 
outcomes included the success rate (complete closure of the TM postoperatively) 
and changes in air-bone conduction gap (ABG) (preoperatively and 
postoperatively) in the audiogram.
RESULTS: Five studies (n = 522) were included. Fat myringoplasty with PRP 
resulted in greater improvement in ABGs (SMD 0.3292, 95% confidence interval 
(CI) [0.1317; 0.5266]) and higher success rates (odds ratio (OR) 3.1289, 95% CI 
[1.8816; 5.2028]) compared to fat myringoplasty alone. In medium-sized 
perforations, combination therapy demonstrated superior outcomes in both success 
rate (success rate (OR 3.1790, 95% CI [1.8914; 5.3432]) and ABG (SMD 0.3569, 95% 
CI [0.1278; 0.5860]). However, no significant differences were observed in cases 
involving small perforations (success rate (OR 2.1538, 95% CI [0.1739; 26.6721]) 
and changes in ABG (SMD 0.2490, 95% CI [-0.1405; 0.6384])). Both liquid and gel 
PRP significantly improved ABGs and TM closure rates, with no significant 
difference between types.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated a higher success rate and greater hearing 
improvement with PRP-assisted fat myringoplasty, especially in medium-sized 
perforations. Both liquid and gel PRP forms were effective, with no significant 
difference between them.

Acute exposure to severe hypoxia impairs cognitive performance, yet the 
integrated brain mechanisms underlying this temporary decline remain unclear. 
This study examined regional variations in cerebral oxygen metabolism during 
acute hypoxia and their relationship to cognitive impairment. Eleven young, 
healthy participants (26.5 ± 4.5 years old) performed the Go/No-Go task during 
two sessions, each of which includes three minutes of hypoxia (FiO2 = 7.7 %). 
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed using pCASL MRI in one session, while 
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals were acquired in another. Fractional 
changes in CBF (δCBF) and BOLD (δBOLD) were combined using a modified Davis 
model, adjusted for physiological differences between normoxia and acute and 
severe hypoxia, to calculate the fractional change in cerebral metabolic rate of 
oxygen (δCMRO2). Group-level z-normalized δCMRO2 maps revealed significant 
regional heterogeneity, with most pronounced reductions in areas associated with 
the dorsal and ventral attention networks and executive frontoparietal networks. 
These regions exhibited δCMRO2 reductions exceeding the hemispheric average 
(-9.6 ± 7.9 %) and were associated with increased commission errors during the 
Go/No-Go task, reflecting impaired inhibitory control and sustained attention. 
This study highlights the brain's adaptive prioritization of certain networks 
under oxygen deprivation, providing insights into the physiological mechanisms 
underlying hypoxia-induced cognitive impairments. These findings enhance our 
understanding of how acute hypoxia affects brain function, emphasizing the 
importance of network-specific adaptations in maintaining cognitive performance 
during oxygen deprivation.

mortality. The interaction between the pulmonary artery (PA) circulation and the 
right ventricle (RV) and association with outcomes is incompletely understood. 
The effective PA elastance (PA Ea) is a composite measure of RV afterload that 
refers to the pulmonary vascular load that the RV must overcome to eject blood. 
Whether PA Ea discriminates mortality risk in unselected patients with 
significant TR is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In consecutive patients with ≥moderate TR, we compared 
all-cause mortality at 5 years based on the PA Ea (defined as the RV systolic 
pressure/stroke volume as measured by transthoracic echocardiography). In a 
total of 12 682 patients, the median PA Ea was 0.7 mm Hg/mL (interquartile range 
0.5, 0.9). Increasing levels of PA Ea were associated with heart failure, liver 
and kidney disease, and clinical markers of risk such as the Tricuspid 
Regurgitation Impact on Outcomes score. Increasing levels of PA Ea were 
associated with larger RVs, worse RV systolic function, higher N-terminal 
pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels, and greater degrees of right heart 
failure. After adjusting for age and sex, PA Ea was associated with higher risk 
of death (hazard ratio 1.55 per 0.5 mm Hg/mL change of PA Ea; 95% confidence 
intervals 1.51-1.60; P < 0.0001). In multivariable modelling incorporating 
available clinical variables, PA Ea was independently predictive of outcome 
compared with other indexes of RV-PA coupling.
CONCLUSION: In patients with significant TR, higher PA Ea is progressively 
associated with RV dysfunction, right heart failure, and worse survival. 
Incorporating PA Ea into the routine echo assessment may help stratify risk.

We report 3-year follow-up results from TRANSFORM comparing lisocabtagene 
maraleucel (liso-cel) versus standard of care (SOC) for second-line primary 
refractory/early relapsed (≤12 months) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Adults 
eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (N = 184) were randomly 
assigned 1:1 to liso-cel (100 × 106 chimeric antigen receptor-positive T cells) 
or SOC. Results are reported descriptively. With a median follow-up of 33.9 
months, median (95% CI) event-free survival was 29.5 months (9.5 to not reached 
[NR]) for liso-cel versus 2.4 months (2.2 to 4.9) for SOC (hazard ratio [HR], 
0.375; 95% CI, 0.259 to 0.542). Median progression-free survival was NR 
(12.6-NR) for liso-cel versus 6.2 months (4.3-8.6) for SOC (HR, 0.422; 95% CI, 
0.279 to 0.639) with 36-month rates of 51% versus 26.5%. Median overall survival 
(OS) was NR for both arms (HR, 0.757; 95% CI, 0.481 to 1.191), with 66% of 
patients crossing over to receive liso-cel; 36-month OS rate was 63% for 
liso-cel versus 52% for SOC. OS HR (0.566 [95% CI, 0.359 to 0.895]) favored 
liso-cel when accounting for the treatment effect of crossover. Safety results 
were consistent with previous reports. At 3-year follow-up, liso-cel confirmed 
superior, more durable efficacy versus SOC with a favorable safety profile and 
no new safety signals. These data support liso-cel as an effective second-line 
treatment with curative potential for relapsed/refractory LBCL.

Foreign body ingestions and esophageal food impactions are common in emergency 
and general medicine settings. Whereas most cases resolve spontaneously, prompt 
evaluation and treatment are paramount in preventing morbidity and death. 
Foreign body ingestion occurs across all age groups, with higher risk in 
children and certain adult populations. Esophageal food impaction, largely due 
to obstruction of the esophagus by food boluses, has an estimated annual 
incidence of 13 per 100,000 person-years. Endoscopy is the preferred 
intervention for both foreign body ingestion and esophageal food impaction, with 
imaging aiding in localization, particularly for sharp objects or suspected 
perforations. Given the strong association of esophageal food impaction with 
eosinophilic esophagitis, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy is recommended 
for these cases, particularly in patients with recurrent impactions.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing public health concern and may influence 
outcomes in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients undergoing peritoneal 
dialysis (PD). However, its impact on in-hospital complications, mortality, and 
healthcare utilization in this population remains unclear. This study aimed to 
assess the association between obesity and hospitalization-related outcomes in 
PD patients.
METHODS: This study was conducted using the National Inpatient Sample to 
identify hospitalized ESKD patients receiving PD from the year 2003 to 2018. The 
in-hospital treatments, outcomes, and resource utilization were compared between 
obese and non-obese patients, adjusting for age, sex, race, year of 
hospitalization, and comorbidities.
RESULTS: A total of 100,523 hospitalized ESKD patients receiving PD were 
included in the analysis. Of these, 9890 (9.8%) had obesity diagnosis. In the 
adjusted analysis, obese patients had a higher need for procedures for PD 
catheter adjustment or removal (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.16-1.43), hemodialysis (OR 
1.28; 95% CI 1.19-1.38), and mechanical ventilation (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.16-1.44), 
compared to non-obese patients. Obesity was significantly associated with higher 
risk of PD peritonitis (OR 1.12; 95% CI 1.06-1.19) and fluid overload (OR 1.34; 
95% CI 1.23-1.45) but lower in-hospital mortality (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.73-0.96). 
There was no significant difference in length of hospital stay and 
hospitalization cost between obese and non-obese patients.
CONCLUSION: Among hospitalized PD patients, obesity is associated with higher 
PD-related complications and increased need for interventions but is 
paradoxically linked to lower in-hospital mortality. These findings provide new 
insights into the obesity paradox in PD and highlight the need for tailored 
management strategies to mitigate obesity-related risks in hospitalized PD 
patients.

BACKGROUND: 18F-flurpiridaz is the newest positron emission tomography 
myocardial perfusion tracer approved in the US for evaluating myocardial 
ischemia and infarction (Flyrcado™, GE HealthCare). The 110 minutes half-life of 
18F enables flurpiridaz to be made and shipped regionally; however, it also 
results in high levels of residual tracer activity for same-day rest/stress 
scanning. This study provides a technical evaluation of immediate back-to-back 
rest/stress flurpiridaz positron emission tomography (PET) with no delay, using 
a commercially available software medical device (mfiVerse™, MultiFunctional 
Imaging LLC) to correct for residual activity effects.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospectively obtained separate-scan dynamic rest and 
pharmacologic stress flurpiridaz images in 11 subjects were digitally shifted 
and combined to model a 15 minute rest/stress procedure with rest scan from 0 to 
8 minutes and stress scan from 8 to 15 minutes, providing a paired-sample study 
design. The modeling of residual tracer effects included both distributed 
activity and stress effects upon residual arterial input. Residual activity 
biased mean stress pixel values and myocardial blood flow (MBF) by +31% and 
+64%, respectively, as compared with the reference stress images without 
residual activity. These biases were each reduced to less than 1% after residual 
activity correction. Linear regression analysis found that corrected stress 
pixel values (r = .998) and MBF (r = .994) closely matched reference stress 
values, both being equivalent to separate-scan values to less than half of 
test-retest variability (P < .001). Summed stress scores averaged 2.5 points 
lower for uncorrected images versus the reference images, and averaged .4 points 
lower after correction.
CONCLUSIONS: Within the study limitations, these results demonstrate that rest 
and stress flurpiridaz PET images can be obtained immediately back-to-back 
without rest-stress delay when accurate correction for residual activity is 
performed.

OBJECTIVE: We assessed whether teleneonatology reduces time to goal temperature 
and early neurologic morbidity or mortality in outborn neonates with 
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) that required therapeutic hypothermia 
(TH).
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective observational study included outborn neonates 
with HIE treated with TH. The exposure was teleneonatology consultation. The 
primary outcome was time from birth to goal temperature (33-34 °C). The 
secondary outcome was a composite of early neurologic morbidity and in-hospital 
mortality.
RESULTS: Of the 77 neonates included in the study, 42 (55%) received 
teleneonatology consultations. Teleneonatology reduced time to goal temperature 
(mean ratio 0.76 [95% CI, 0.58, 0.99]). This was partially mediated by earlier 
transport team activation and more frequent initiation of passive cooling prior 
to transport team arrival. There was no difference in early neurologic morbidity 
or mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Teleneonatology reduced time to goal temperature in outborn 
neonates with HIE requiring TH by expediting key steps in care processes.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of modifiable surgical factors on 
ossiculoplasty outcomes after controlling for ear environment risk.
STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional retrospective review.
SETTING: Six tertiary care centers from 2011 to 2019.
PATIENTS: Adults and children.
INTERVENTIONS: Ossiculoplasty, including synthetic ossicular replacement 
prosthesis, autograft interposition, bone cement repair, and mobilization.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Correlation between modifiable surgical factors and 
pure-tone average air-bone gap (ABG) at most recent audiogram after controlling 
for preoperative risk using the statistically validated Ear Environment Risk 
(EER) score.
RESULTS: A total of 1,679 cases were included with a median follow-up time of 20 
months (IQR, 5-51). After controlling for EER score, malleus engagement of 
prosthesis yielded favorable ABG versus direct contact to tympanic membrane 
without malleus engagement (beta = -2.4 dB [-3.8, -1.1], p < 0.001). For total 
ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP), use of a footplate prosthesis yielded 
favorable ABG as compared with no footplate prosthesis (-3.6 dB [-6.1, -1.1], p 
= 0.005). For synthetic prostheses, polyethylene prostheses had a less favorable 
ABG compared with full titanium or titanium with hydroxyapatite prostheses (p < 
0.05). In cases where the malleus was not engaged in reconstruction, amputation 
of the malleus head yielded worse ABG (+3.9 dB [1.2, 6.7], p = 0.005). There was 
no significant difference (p > 0.05) in ABG for single-stage versus multistaged 
approach, use of a cartilage cap over the prosthesis versus no cartilage, use of 
bone cement to secure a PORP to the stapes versus no cement, mastoid cavity 
obliteration versus no obliteration, and incudostapedial joint reconstruction 
with joint prosthesis/bone cement versus synthetic PORP.
CONCLUSIONS: With statistical correction for ear environment risk, several 
modifiable surgical factors are noted to impact ossiculoplasty hearing outcomes.

Wild-type transthyretin (ATTRwt) amyloidosis typically presents with restrictive 
cardiomyopathy. Kidney involvement is exceedingly rare. We report to our 
knowledge the first antemortem diagnosis of ATTRwt amyloidosis with kidney 
vasculature deposition in a patient presenting with progressive kidney failure. 
Notably, technetium-99m pyrophosphate scintigraphy showed no myocardial uptake. 
This case expands the known spectrum of organ involvement in ATTRwt amyloidosis 
and underscores the need to consider extracardiac manifestations in its 
diagnosis.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) block immunoregulatory receptor-ligand 
interactions and robustly increase survival of cancer patients but frequently 
result in immune-related adverse events (irAEs). While rheumatologic toxicities 
are commonly reported as irAEs, the effect of immune checkpoint blockade on the 
underlying mechanisms of ICI-induced fractures and bone loss is controversial, 
with reports of both positive and negative effects on bone mass in preclinical 
models. However, no previous reports have investigated the impact of ICIs on 
females or aged mice, or on fracture risk in either sex. We report that global 
deletion of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) broadly results in bone loss 
in skeletally mature male and female PD-1-/- mice, with a sexually divergent 
phenotype in adolescent mice, decreased bone strength in adult males and young 
females, and expansion of multiple T cell subsets in the bone marrow. In a model 
of pharmacologic PD-1 blockade, administration of α-PD-1 reduced bone mass, 
expanded multiple T cell subsets in the bone marrow, and increased osteoclast 
activity and resorptive capacity. T cell deficient mice were resistant to 
osteoclast-mediated bone loss following α-PD-1 therapy, suggesting that T cells 
in the bone marrow are necessary for bone loss in the setting of ICI therapy. 
These findings may be leveraged to identify patients at greater fracture risk 
following ICI therapy due to enrichment of effector T cell populations in the 
bone marrow.

Plain Language Summary: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a new and 
clinically successful class of drugs that are FDA approved for treating more 
than 14 tumor types, both alone and in combination with other anti-cancer 
therapies. Cancer patients treated with ICIs can develop bone loss and increased 
fracture risk, but the reason for these effects is unknown and has not been 
investigated in both males and females over the lifespan. We report here that 
ICIs reduce bone mass in adult and aged mice, and this is caused in part by 
increased activity of bone-resorbing cells.

BACKGROUND: To investigate sertraline and ranolazine exposure in adult patients 
with lipid storage myopathy (LSM), given recent reports of their potential 
association with the condition.
METHODS: We reviewed electronic health records to identify adult patients with a 
pathological and/or genetic diagnosis of LSM, who were evaluated at the Mayo 
Clinic (January 2000-December 2021). Patients without genetic testing were 
excluded.
RESULTS: We identified 10 patients with LSM, including 8 with multiple acyl-CoA 
dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) and 2 with subacute LSM after ranolazine 
initiation. Genetic testing revealed an underlying molecular defect in only 3 
MADD patients. Sertraline exposure was noted in 4 MADD patients, none of whom 
had an identified genetic defect. Muscle biopsy findings were similar across 
patients with hereditary MADD, sertraline-associated MADD, and 
ranolazine-associated LSM, all demonstrating excessive lipid accumulation and 
attenuation of succinate dehydrogenase reactivity. MADD patients showed a 
favorable response to riboflavin and coenzyme Q10 supplementation, regardless of 
genetic test results. Patients with ranolazine-associated LSM improved following 
discontinuation of the drug.
CONCLUSIONS: LSM is rare in adults but important to recognize due to its 
treatability and potential drug-induced cases in a significant proportion of 
patients. Weakness in individuals taking sertraline or ranolazine should prompt 
consideration of LSM.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Truncating variants in the TTN gene (TTNtv) are the most 
common genetic cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) but also occur as 
incidental findings in the general population. This study investigated factors 
associated with the clinical manifestation of TTNtv.
METHODS: An international multicentre retrospective observational study was 
performed in families with TTNtv-related DCM. Shared frailty models were used to 
estimate associations of variant characteristics with lifetime risk of DCM, and 
logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for individual-level clinical 
risk factor profiles (cardiac conditions, cardiovascular comorbidities, 
lifestyle) and DCM.
RESULTS: A total of 3158 subjects in 1043 families with TTNtv-related DCM were 
studied. TTNtv-positive subjects were 21-fold more likely to develop DCM [OR, 
21.21; 95% confidence interval (CI), 14.80-30.39]. Disease onset was earlier in 
males, but was similar for TTNtv of different types and locations. The presence 
of clinical risk factors was associated with earlier DCM onset (OR, 3.41; 95% 
CI, 2.06-5.64), with a prior history of atrial fibrillation having a two-fold 
increased odds of DCM (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.27-3.32). The prevalence of clinical 
risk factors increased with age; however, the strength of the DCM association 
was greatest for young-onset (<30 years) disease (OR, 4.75; 95% CI, 2.35-9.60). 
Administration of beta-adrenergic receptor or renin-angiotensin system-blocking 
drugs prior to overt DCM was associated with 87% reduced odds of DCM (OR, .13; 
95% CI, .08-.23).
CONCLUSIONS: Disease onset in TTNtv-associated familial DCM is dependent on 
individual patient context and is potentially modifiable by risk factor 
management and prophylactic therapeutic intervention.

This study longitudinally examined associations between parent and peer 
relationships, childhood maltreatment, and adolescents' psychopathology. We 
expected lower perceived parental relationship quality to predict greater 
symptomatology and higher perceived friendship quality to buffer this 
association, with greater buffering effects for maltreated participants. We 
assessed 545 participants (295 maltreated, 250 non-maltreated; 60.2% male; 52.8% 
Black, 27.5% White, 12.8% Bi-racial, 13.4% Latin@) across two timepoints (Wave 
1, Mage = 13.8 years, Wave 2,Mage = 16.2 years). Department of Human Services 
records indicated maltreatment status prior to Wave 1. Adolescents self-reported 
Wave 1 parental relationship and friendship quality and Wave 2 
internalizing/externalizing symptoms. Parental relationship quality did not 
predict psychopathology, and this association did not differ by maltreatment 
status. We found a significant three-way interaction between maternal 
relationship quality, maltreatment, and friendship quality on internalizing (β = 
.10, p = .037) and externalizing (β = .12, p = .010) symptoms. For 
non-maltreated adolescents, parental relationships and friendship quality 
differentially predicted symptomatology. Maltreated adolescents with low 
maternal relationship and friendship quality exhibited the most symptoms, 
whereas those with low maternal relationship quality and high friendship quality 
exhibited the least. Findings invite inquiry into parent and peer relationships' 
differential roles in adolescents' psychopathology.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to synthesize current evidence on the 
expanding role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) beyond 
glycemic control, particularly in the context of critical illness. With growing 
recognition of their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and organ-protective 
properties, GLP-1RAs show promise in managing complications such as sepsis, 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury, and multiorgan 
dysfunction. This review explores their mechanisms across vital systems - 
including cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, neuropsychiatric, and 
gut-lung-microbiome axes - highlighting preclinical and clinical data. By 
consolidating emerging findings, this review aims to inform future translational 
research and support the integration of GLP-1RAs into critical care strategies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence highlights GLP-1RAs as promising adjuncts in 
critical illness due to their multiorgan protective effects. In cardiovascular 
systems, GLP-1RAs improve endothelial function, reduce ischemia-reperfusion 
injury, and modulate autonomic tone. In the CNS, they provide neuroprotection by 
reducing neuroinflammation and pyroptosis. In the lungs, they attenuate ARDS by 
decreasing cytokine production, enhancing surfactant secretion, and restoring 
alveolar-capillary integrity. Renally, they reduce acute injury and preserve 
filtration function. In the gut, GLP-1RAs modulate the microbiome, enhance 
barrier integrity, and lower systemic inflammation via the gut-lung axis. 
Additionally, they reduce hepatic inflammation and support pancreatic beta-cell 
survival, improving insulin sensitivity and metabolic stability in critical 
care.
SUMMARY: GLP-1 receptor agonists hold promise as multiorgan protective agents in 
critical illness, offering benefits beyond glucose control. Their 
anti-inflammatory, metabolic, and vaso-protective properties may be harnessed to 
prevent or attenuate organ failure, support recovery, and improve long-term 
outcomes in critically ill patients. Further clinical trials are warranted to 
define their safety, efficacy, and optimal application across ICU populations.

Alignment Strategies in Total Knee Arthroplasty and How to Effectively Achieve 
Them.

Ji B(1), Guarin Perez SF, Pagnano MW, Sierra RJ, Perry KI.

Author information:

Department of Orthopedic, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical 
University, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China (Ji), and the Department of Orthopedic 
Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN (Guarin Perez, Pagnano, Sierra, and Perry).

Orthopedic surgeons now have multiple alignment strategies for total knee 
arthroplasty. Unlike the era dominated by mechanical alignment, the availability 
of diverse paradigms introduces both flexibility and potential uncertainty in 
selecting optimal lower limb alignment. The published literature does not show 
marked differences in outcomes between standard mechanical and newer alternative 
alignment strategies, which is at once reassuring and frustrating. Reassuring 
because the reliability and durability of total knee arthroplasty appears 
similar and yet frustrating because comparisons among the techniques often hinge 
on individual surgeon preferences more than objective data. This review focuses 
on surgical techniques, highlights differences between mechanical alignment 
principles and constitutional alignment principles, and compares and contrasts 
those strategies that primarily focus on coronal plane alignment versus those 
that deliberately consider three-dimensional alignment. We consider mechanical 
and anatomic alignment strategies to primarily target coronal plane alignment, 
whereas kinematic and functional alignment focus on three-dimensional 
constitutional knee alignment. A clear analysis of the advantages, limitations, 
and the latest clinical outcomes of each alignment strategy is presented. Using 
surgical illustrations and insightful tips and tricks, this review aims to serve 
as a technical guidebook, offering useful insights for clinicians to achieve 
their desired knee alignment goals.

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is a bariatric surgery associated with durable 
long-term weight loss in most, but not all, patients. Transoral outlet reduction 
(TORe) is an endoscopic procedure that reduces the gastrojejunostomy diameter 
and gastric pouch volume to promote weight loss in patients with recurrent 
weight gain after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. This systematic review and 
meta-analysis, conducted by the Association for Bariatric Endoscopy in 
collaboration with the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) 
Technology Committee, aimed to evaluate whether TORe meets the performance 
thresholds outlined in the ASGE preservation and incorporation of valuable 
endoscopic innovations (PIVI) document for the clinical adoption of endoscopic 
bariatric therapies. At 12 months post-TORe, the pooled total weight loss (TWL) 
across 12 studies (1154 patients) was 8.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
6.5%-11.3%; P < .0001), meeting the prespecified PIVI threshold of 5% TWL. 
Subgroup analysis by device showed comparable 12-month weight loss with either 
suturing TORe (11 studies, 1043 patients) or plication TORe (1 study, 110 
patients), achieving 8.9% (95% CI, 6.2%-11.5%) TWL and 9.5% (95% CI, 7.8%-11.3%) 
TWL, respectively (P = .07). Subgroup analysis by suture pattern demonstrated 
significantly greater weight loss with the pursestring suture pattern (5 
studies, 687 patients), achieving 12.8% TWL (95% CI, 7.8%-17.8%), whereas 
non-pursestring patterns (6 studies, 306 patients) yielded 6.5% TWL (95% CI, 
4.5%-8.4%), which did not meet the PIVI threshold. The pooled serious adverse 
event rate across 15 studies (1373 patients) was 1.5% (95% CI, 0.8%-2.6%; P < 
.0001), meeting the PIVI threshold of ≤5% for serious adverse events. In 
summary, this PIVI assessment determined that the TORe procedure meets the ASGE 
PIVI thresholds for both effectiveness and safety, supporting its clinical 
adoption regardless of the device used. For suturing TORe, the pursestring 
suture pattern appears to be associated with superior outcomes compared to other 
suturing techniques. This PIVI assessment will be updated as additional data 
become available.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal human cancer. 
Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy remains the cornerstone for advanced PDAC. 
However, resistance to chemotherapy greatly limits its clinical therapeutic 
efficacy. Accordingly, the identification of novel therapeutic targets to 
overcome chemoresistance and improve prognosis is urgently needed. Screening of 
deubiquitinase family members, tandem affinity purification, mass spectrometry, 
and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis were performed to predict the interactions 
and function of the CDK5-USP32-Rap1 axis in PDAC. In vitro and in vivo 
experiments were performed to elucidate the regulatory mechanism and biological 
roles of this axis in glycolytic reprogramming and chemoresistance in PDAC. 
Finally, TCGA database analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed to 
determine the expression and clinical significance of CDK5, USP32, and Rap1 in 
PDAC tissues. USP32 was identified as a bona fide deubiquitinase of Rap1. USP32 
deubiquitinates and stabilizes Rap1, thereby promoting glycolytic reprogramming 
and chemoresistance in PDAC cells. Moreover, we unexpectedly found that 
CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of USP32 is required for its deubiquitinase 
activity toward Rap1 and drives malignant phenotypes of PDAC. Additionally, 
these functions can be significantly inhibited by pharmacological inhibition 
(roscovitine) or genetic ablation of CDK5. Importantly, combining a CDK5 
inhibitor with gemcitabine has a synergetic anticancer effect. Indeed, the 
effectiveness of targeting CDK5 to sensitize PDAC cells to gemcitabine was 
confirmed in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. CDK5 and USP32 expression 
is markedly elevated in PDAC samples and positively associated with Rap1 
expression. Increased expression of CDK5, USP32, and Rap1 is significantly 
associated with poorer prognosis in PDAC. We identified the previously 
unrecognized oncogenic function and clinical importance of the CDK5-USP32-Rap1 
axis, providing preclinical evidence for potential new combination strategies 
for PDAC therapy.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is a leading 
cause of cognitive and functional deficits. Retinal vasculature abnormalities 
may be an early indicator of CSVD. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
associations between retinal signs in midlife and imaging markers of CSVD 18 
years later.
METHODS: This study included participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in 
Communities Study, a prospective community-based cohort, who had retinal imaging 
at visit 3 (1993-1995) and 3T brain MRI at visit 5 (2011-2013). MRI scans were 
reviewed centrally and rated for white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes 
(present vs absent), cerebral microbleeds (present vs absent), brain volumes 
(total, lobar, temporoparietal meta region of interest, deep gray subcortical 
structure), global fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) obtained 
from diffusion tensor imaging. Retinal imaging was evaluated centrally for 4 
retinal signs: (1) central retinal arteriolar equivalent-lowest (worst) quartile 
vs top 3 quartiles; (2) arteriovenous nicking (present vs absent); (3) focal 
arteriolar narrowing (present vs absent); (4) retinopathy (mild, moderate, 
severe vs none). We used multivariable-adjusted Poisson regression with robust 
SEs for lacunes and cerebral microbleeds and linear regression for other MRI 
measures. Models were adjusted for age, sex, race-center, education, APOE ε4 
allele, smoking, drinking, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, and 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We also adjusted for intracranial volume 
when WMHs and brain volumes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Among 1,809 participants (mean visit 3 age = 59 years, mean visit 5 age 
= 77 years, 60% female, 27% Black), comparing participants with focal arteriolar 
narrowing present vs absent, worse white matter integrity (FA: difference = 
-0.006, 95% CI -0.010 to -0.001; MD: difference = 0.141 × 10-4 mm2/s, 95% CI 
0.047-0.235) and higher WMH burden (difference = 5.119 cm3, 95% CI 1.352-8.885) 
were found, after adjusting for demographic and cardiovascular factors. 
Retinopathy was associated with cerebral microbleeds (prevalence ratio = 1.597, 
95% CI 1.052-2.426). We did not find other significant associations between 
retinal microvascular signs and brain MRI measures.
DISCUSSION: Midlife retinal microvascular abnormalities may be a valuable risk 
indicator of late-life CSVD neuroimaging markers. Retinal fundus photography 
might be a promising tool for early identification of CSVD.

PURPOSE: To use machine learning to predict new-onset shock for at-risk 
intensive care unit (ICU) patients based on discrete vital sign data from the 
electronic health record.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 11,305 adult cardiac, medical, neurological, 
and surgical ICU patients who did not have shock within 4 h of ICU admission. We 
used routine vital sign data collected from the first 4 h of the ICU stay to 
predict new-onset shock within the subsequent 4 h. We compared logistic 
regression with machine learning models including elastic net, random forest, 
boosted trees and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). Median age was 64.0 years 
(44.5 % females). New-onset shock after 4 h developed in 483 (4.3 %) patients, 
and these patients had higher ICU (8.5 % vs. 1.9 %) and in-hospital (14.3 % vs. 
5.0 %) mortality. Standard logistic regression had limited discrimination for 
new-onset shock, with the best single predictors being the maximum shock index 
and the minimum blood pressure during the second 2 h of the ICU stay. 
Discrimination in the validation cohort (n = 2826) was better for each ML model: 
elastic net, 0.76; boosted tree, 0.76; random forest, 0.79; XGB, 0.82; each 
model had ≥ 98 % negative predictive value. Accuracy was highest (81 %) with 
XGB, although positive predictive value was only 14 %. The XGB model also 
predicted in-hospital mortality with good discrimination.
CONCLUSIONS: Machine learning prediction models can achieve very good 
discrimination and accuracy for new-onset shock in ICU patients using vital sign 
data within 4 h after ICU admission.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the utility of a metagenomic microbial plasma cell-free DNA 
next-generation sequencing assay (Karius Test [KT]) in the evaluation of 
patients in an outpatient rheumatology practice.
METHODS: All patients with a KT ordered and obtained by a rheumatology provider 
in the outpatient setting from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2022, were 
retrospectively identified. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, radiologic, 
histopathology, and microbial studies were abstracted. Indication for KT testing 
was categorized. KT results were defined based on positive result and clinical 
relevance regarding the symptoms under investigation at the time of the 
rheumatologic investigation. Review of cases 3 months after KT was undertaken to 
determine clinical outcome.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients with a KT were included (52.7% female, mean 
age 52 years). The reason for KT was evaluation of atypical presentation of 
rheumatic disease (80%), assessing flare vs infection in patients on 
immunosuppression (16.7%), and fever of unknown origin (3.3%). Twenty-four (16%) 
KTs were positive, 6 of which were considered clinically relevant and altered 
the final diagnosis and treatment. Of the 126 negative KTs, 5 (4%) were found to 
have a clinically relevant infection by conventional testing methodologies.
CONCLUSION: In this large retrospective cohort study, the most frequent reason 
for KT utilization was an atypical presentation of rheumatic disease. One out of 
4 positive KTs altered the final diagnosis and treatment. False negative rates 
were low. KT has utility in outpatient rheumatology assessments. Further 
delineation of which patients are best suited for KT testing remains to be 
defined.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of surgical team consistency on patient 
outcomes following radical prostatectomy (RP).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing RP at a single institution from 2010 
to 2019 were identified. The surgical care team comprised three members: a 
certified surgical assistant, a certified surgical technologist, and a 
circulating nurse. Primary team member status for each of the three roles was 
assigned on a quarterly basis to team members who were present for the highest 
proportion of a surgeon's cases. For each procedure, the surgical care team 
present at the time of the surgical timeout was assessed. Low-consistency teams 
were defined as those with zero to one primary team members present for a 
procedure, and high-consistency teams were defined as those with two to three 
primary team members present. Outcomes included prostate cancer recurrence as 
well as urinary continence and erectile function (assessed at 1 year after 
surgery). Cox-proportional hazard regression models evaluated the association of 
care team consistency with oncologic outcomes, controlling for clinicopathologic 
variables.
RESULTS: Overall, 4188 of 6216 (67.3%) RPs were performed with high-consistency 
teams. High-consistency surgical teams were associated with significantly 
improved 5-year prostate cancer recurrence-free survival (76% vs 72.9%; P=.009). 
On multivariable analysis, high-consistency teams remained significantly 
associated with a lower rate of prostate cancer recurrence (HR, 0.93; P=.01). 
One year postoperatively, high-consistency teams had significantly higher 
urinary continence rates (0-1 pads/d) (93.9% vs 90.3%; P<.0001) and lower rates 
of erectile dysfunction (32.9% vs 35.2%; P=.02).
CONCLUSION: High-consistency surgical teams during RP are associated with 
significantly lower rates of prostate cancer recurrence and improved functional 
outcomes.

INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Procedural therapies for overactive bladder (OAB) 
most often include intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxinA (BTX) injections, sacral 
neuromodulation (SNM), and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS). Despite 
their proven efficacy, real-world data on therapy continuation and crossover 
rates between these modalities remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate 
longitudinal patterns of treatment continuation and therapy crossover among 
women receiving procedural OAB treatments.
METHODS: We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of women 
with idiopathic OAB who underwent index BTX, SNM, or PTNS between 2014 and 2022. 
Patients were identified using electronic medical records, and follow-up data 
were collected through December 31, 2023. The primary outcomes included duration 
of maintenance treatments and crossover to another procedural therapy for OAB. 
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis estimated rates of continued treatment, and a 
log-rank test assessed differences in crossover rates among treatment groups.
RESULTS: A total of 506 women met inclusion criteria: 266 (52.6%) received BTX, 
114 (22.5%) underwent SNM, and 126 (24.9%) received PTNS. Ongoing treatment 
rates were lowest for PTNS, with only 17.1% maintaining therapy between 3 and 5 
years and 26.1% crossing over to another procedure within 3 years. Among BTX 
patients, 65.2% underwent repeat treatment within 3 years, and 9.5% of patients 
crossed over to another procedure within 3 years. Of those with 5 or more years 
of follow-up, 39.1% of patients continued with BTX procedures in the 3-5-year 
follow-up timeframe. Among SNM patients, the cumulative revision rates were 7.6% 
at 1 year and 10.9% at 2 years. 13.1% of patients crossed over from SNM to 
another procedure within 3 years (the vast majority to BTX).
CONCLUSIONS: PTNS had the lowest ongoing therapy rates and the highest crossover 
rates. BTX and SNM demonstrated similar crossover rates. These findings 
underscore the importance of individualized patient counseling and treatment 
selection based on expectations of therapy persistence. Future research should 
focus on optimizing patient selection, improving long-term adherence strategies, 
and evaluating novel or combined therapeutic approaches for OAB management.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Bone health is a critical determinant of spine 
surgery outcomes, yet many patients undergo procedures without adequate 
preoperative assessment due to limitations in current bone quality assessment 
methods. This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial 
intelligence-based algorithm that predicts Vertebral Bone Quality (VBQ) scores 
from routine MRI scans, enabling improved preoperative identification of 
patients at risk for poor surgical outcomes.
METHODS: This study utilized 257 lumbar spine T1-weighted MRI scans from the 
SPIDER challenge dataset. VBQ scores were calculated through a three-step 
process: selecting the mid-sagittal slice, measuring vertebral body signal 
intensity from L1-L4, and normalizing by cerebrospinal fluid signal intensity. A 
YOLOv8 model was developed to automate region of interest placement and VBQ 
score calculation. The system was validated against manual annotations from 47 
lumbar spine surgery patients, with performance evaluated using precision, 
recall, mean average precision, intraclass correlation coefficient, Pearson 
correlation, RMSE, and mean error.
RESULTS: The YOLOv8 model demonstrated high accuracy in vertebral body detection 
(precision: 0.9429, recall: 0.9076, mAP@0.5: 0.9403, mAP@[0.5:0.95]: 0.8288). 
Strong interrater reliability was observed with ICC values of 0.95 
(human-human), 0.88 and 0.93 (human-AI). Pearson correlations for VBQ scores 
between human and AI measurements were 0.86 and 0.9, with RMSE values of 0.58 
and 0.42 respectively.
CONCLUSION: The AI-based algorithm accurately predicts VBQ scores from routine 
lumbar MRIs. This approach has potential to enhance early identification and 
intervention for patients with poor bone health, leading to improved surgical 
outcomes. Further external validation is recommended to ensure generalizability 
and clinical applicability.

BACKGROUND: Malignant Peripheral Nerve Sheath Tumors (MPNSTs) are rare, 
aggressive sarcomas, with 40% associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). 
Surgical excision is the main treatment for localized disease, however, local 
recurrence (LR) remains high. Radiotherapy (RTx) is increasingly used to enhance 
local control in STS, but its use remains controversial due to the potential for 
increased major wound complications and an increased risk of secondary 
malignancies in NF1 patients. This study investigated the use and impact of RTx 
on local control in MPNSTs, particularly in the NF1 setting.
METHODS: Surgically treated primary MPNSTs from 1988 to 2019 in the MONACO 
multicenter cohort were included. Differences in demographics, treatment, and 
RTx use between NF1 and non-NF1 cases were examined. Factors influencing RTx 
administration and LR were assessed via multivariable analyses.
RESULTS: Among 499 patients (33.1% NF1), 143 (28.7%) experienced LRs. 
Radiotherapy was administered to 56.3% of patients (57.0% in the NF1 group), 
with 27.3% receiving neoadjuvant and 72.7% adjuvant RTx. RTx was administered 
significantly more often to high-grade and extremity tumors. While RTx did not 
affect overall survival, it reduced LR risk in sporadic cases (HR 0.530; 95% CI 
0.354-0.793) but not in the NF1 subgroup (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.545-1.85). In NF1 
patients, a microscopically positive margin (R1) was the only risk factor for LR 
development (HR 2.1; 95% CI, 1.19-3.79).
CONCLUSIONS: RTx is frequently used in the treatment of MPNSTs, regardless of 
NF1 status. While it may affect LR rate in sporadic cases, its impact in NF1 
patients is less clear.

BACKGROUND: Hemorrhage is the most common cause of potentially preventable death 
after injury. Balanced transfusion with red blood cells, plasma, and platelets 
(component therapy, CT) has been shown to reduce mortality, and is the standard 
of care. Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood (LTOWB) is an attractive alternative to 
CT, but existing evidence comprises observational studies, and a small single 
center pilot randomized controlled trial, which evaluated a type of whole blood 
that is no longer in use. The aim of the "Trauma Resuscitation with Low-Titer 
Group O Whole Blood Or Products" (TROOP) trial is to compare the effectiveness 
and safety of LTOWB and CT in critically injured patients predicted to require a 
large volume transfusion.
METHODS: This is a pragmatic, multicenter, Bayesian, sequential 
non-inferiority/superiority, randomized clinical trial, performed within 15 
level I trauma centers in the United States. We aim to randomize 1,100 injured 
patients to resuscitation with either CT or LTOWB. The primary outcome is 6-h 
mortality. Secondary outcomes include 24-h and 30-day or hospital mortality 
(whichever is earlier); prespecified complications; adjudicated cause of death; 
time to death; length of stay (ICU and hospital); and hospital-, ventilator- and 
ICU-free days; the incidence of major surgical procedures; time to hemostasis in 
those undergoing procedures with a hemostatic component; number and type of 
blood products used until hemostasis is achieved (and randomized products are 
discontinued), as well as after hemostasis has been achieved, to 24 h 
post-admission; discharge destination and functional status and quality of life 
at hospital discharge or 30 days, as measured by Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and 
EuroQol (EQ-5D) quality of life measurement.
DISCUSSION: This large multicenter clinical trial will contribute high-level 
evidence on the effectiveness of Low-Titer Group O Whole Blood in the 
in-hospital management of trauma patients predicted to require a large volume 
transfusion. Trial registration National Clinical Trial Identified Number:

BACKGROUND: Massive pulmonary embolism (PE) causing obstructive shock can lead 
to circulatory failure and cardiac arrest. There is a paucity of data describing 
current practice around thrombolytic use and outcomes in this patient 
population.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics and 
outcomes of patients who received a thrombolytic agent during cardiac arrest due 
to suspected PE, including efficacy and safety.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective, descriptive cohort of 32 adult patients 
who received alteplase or tenecteplase in the emergency department during active 
cardiac arrest. Agent selection and dosing were at the discretion of the primary 
provider.
RESULTS: Most patients presented with a witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
with a non-shockable rhythm. The mean age was 63 years. Dyspnea was most 
commonly reported prior to cardiac arrest. The median dose for alteplase was 
50 mg and for tenecteplase was 45 mg. Eleven patients achieved ROSC after 
thrombolytic administration; seven of these patients survived to hospital 
admission. All but one patient experienced a major bleeding event during 
admission. Ultimately, only two patients survived to hospital discharge. A 
subgroup analysis compared patients administered alteplase to those administered 
tenecteplase. Nine of the eleven patients that achieved ROSC were administered 
alteplase, five of which survived to hospital admission. All five patients 
experienced a major bleeding event. Two of the eleven patients that achieved 
ROSC were administered tenecteplase, both of which survived to hospital 
admission. One patient experienced a major bleeding event. Ultimately, only one 
patient in each group survived to hospital discharge.
CONCLUSION: This study provides new data regarding the outcomes of thrombolytic 
therapy in patients experiencing cardiac arrest due to suspected massive PE. 
Despite administration of thrombolytics, survival to hospital admission and 
subsequent survival to hospital discharge were seen in only a very small 
proportion of patients. Further research is necessary to optimize the management 
of this life-threatening condition.

BACKGROUND: Several guidelines groups have made recommendations about how to use 
natriuretic peptides (NPs) to screen patients with diabetes for incipient heart 
failure. This group is at risk for undetected and stage B heart failure, where 
structural heart disease is present despite the absence of clinical signs and 
symptoms. These recommendations are based on trial data that suggest there are 
therapeutic options to benefit these patients.
CONTENT: These guidelines do not adequately account for the marked analytic 
differences between NP assays nor their high degree of biological and analytical 
variability. Thus, without additional data and guidance, these recommendations 
could lead to excessive testing for some groups but might disadvantage others. 
In addition, these issues could lead to difficulties in the interpretation of 
values. Accordingly, the Committee on Clinical Applications of Cardiac Bio 
Markers of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry has developed a 
consensus educational document to describe these difficulties and define areas 
where additional data are needed. Clinicians should be cognizant of differences 
in the assays for NPs, the high degree of variability of values, differences in 
sex and ethnicity and the need to factor in a variety of clinical and treatment 
variables in interpreting NP values.
SUMMARY: These suggestions for diabetes eventually will include others at high 
risk. They will require close attention to the issues involved in measuring and 
interpreting NP values.

Rituximab (RTX) is a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody widely used to treat B-cell 
neoplasms and autoimmune conditions. RTX has recently been linked to an 
enteropathy characterized by diarrhea, malabsorption, and hypogammaglobulinemia, 
closely resembling common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) enteropathy. We 
present the first dedicated histopathologic assessment of RTX-associated 
CVID-like enteropathy. Study inclusion criteria were the presence of diarrhea, 
weight loss, or other gastrointestinal symptoms in the setting of current/prior 
RTX use and associated hypogammaglobulinemia. Twenty-two patients (15 male:7 
female; mean age at biopsy/resection, 63.4 years) across 9 tertiary medical 
centers met inclusion criteria and had small bowel (N = 20) and/or colon (N = 
17) specimens (biopsies/resections) available for review; 71.4% of specimens 
dated from ≤5 years of last RTX dose. Cases were systematically evaluated by 
gastrointestinal pathologists at each institution. Key histologic features in 
the small bowel included sparse/absent lamina propria plasma cells (N = 10; 
50%), intraepithelial lymphocytosis (N = 12; 60%), villous atrophy (N = 11; 
55%), increased crypt apoptotic bodies (N = 6; 30%), and active inflammation (N 
= 5; 25%). Common features in the colon included sparse/absent plasma cells (N = 
7; 41.2%), increased crypt apoptotic bodies (N = 7; 41.2%), active inflammation 
(N = 5; 29.4%), and intraepithelial lymphocytosis (N = 4; 23.5%). Goblet cell 
loss was appreciated in small bowel and/or colon specimens from 2 patients. 
Follow-up biopsies (interval, 2 months to 4 years) were available for 7 patients 
and largely recapitulated the histology of the index specimens, though 1 patient 
demonstrated improvement in villous blunting and intraepithelial lymphocytosis. 
In summary, the histologic spectrum of post-RTX CVID-like enteropathy 
encompasses lamina propria plasma cell depletion, increased crypt apoptotic 
bodies, small bowel villous atrophy, and goblet cell loss. While the underlying 
pathophysiology remains uncertain, the clinicopathologic picture may reflect 
post-RTX B-cell/plasma cell impairment. Although histologic findings may be 
subtle and variable, pathologists should be aware of this entity and should seek 
a history of RTX use in patients whose biopsies exhibit these CVID 
enteropathy-like features.

We report a case of novel radiation treatment referred to as minibeam radiation 
therapy (MBRT) that was used to treat recurrent mucosal melanoma. The patient's 
disease recurred after surgery, conventional radiation therapy, and 4 lines of 
systemic therapy, and then, the patient was referred to our clinic. Despite 
substantial disease progression after multiple prior therapies, a complete 
metabolic and clinical response, along with an improved quality of life and 
performance status, was achieved after 2 treatments of MBRT. Additionally, 
disease response was noted in an unirradiated abdominal metastasis. The MBRT 
treatments were well-tolerated, with minimal toxicity reported more than 6 
months posttreatment. This case highlights the potential of MBRT as a completely 
novel form of radiation therapy that warrants further study.

BACKGROUND: A novel individualized antitachycardia pacing (IATP) algorithm using 
the post-pacing interval for real-time control has been introduced. Performance 
information is limited to a small safety and feasibility study with additional 
single-center and case studies. A larger-scale analysis is needed to better 
understand algorithm performance.
METHODS: Deidentified remote monitoring transmissions from devices with the IATP 
therapy applied were randomly selected. Rhythms were classified and effects of 
the novel algorithm were assessed. For monomorphic ventricular tachycardias 
(MVTs) proportions of successful therapy, shock-free episodes, and acceleration 
were calculated using generalized estimating equations to correct for multiple 
episodes and compute statistics of the algorithm's performance.
RESULTS: There were 2259 MVT episodes in 336 patients. IATP succeeded in 87.1% 
of MVT episodes with 89.9% of MVT episodes ultimately free of shock therapy. 
Based on multivariate analysis, significant factors in therapy success were 
programming of at least the recommended number of sequences (90% at least 
recommended vs 73%, p = 0.00088) and female sex (95% for females vs 86%, 
p = 0.002). A trend to higher success was found for MVT with a cycle length of 
320 ms or greater (90% vs. 83%, p = 0.10). The IATP accelerated 3.6% of MVT 
episodes. None of the available factors was significantly associated with 
acceleration in the multivariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: The IATP algorithm succeeded in a large proportion of MVT episodes 
and with low acceleration in patients randomly selected from remote monitoring 
transmissions. Using at least the recommended number of sequences had the 
strongest association with successful therapy.

SETBP1 gene, located on 18q12.3, is a major oncogene in myeloid neoplasms. GATA2 
gene, located on 3q21, is one of the six GATA transcription factors regulating 
gene expression via two conserved zinc finger domains (ZF). Previous data 
suggested that in patients with germline GATA2 mutation (m), acquisition of a 
somatic SETBP1 mutation (m) was associated with leukemic transformation among 
patients with AML, excess blast MDS and CMML. We hypothesize that the 
co-occurrence of SETBP1m and GATA2m have a unique impact on the clinical and 
molecular characteristics of myeloid neoplasms. After IRB approval, we 
retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who had myeloid NGS panel 
results between 2016 and 2023. All patients with myeloid neoplasms who had 
either SETBP1m or GATA2m were included. One hundred sixty-eight patients had 
either SETBP1m and/or GATA2m; 105 patients had SETBP1m, 54 had GATA2m and 9 had 
both SETBP1m and GATA2m. Majority (66.1 %) were males with a median age of 71.3 
years. At time of NGS, MDS/MPN was the most common diagnosis (32.1 %), followed 
by MDS (30 %) and AML (20.2 %). In SETBP1m/GATA2m patients, 7 GATA2m clustered 
in zinc finger 2 (ZF2) (77.8 %); higher than the ZF2 mutated cases among 
SETBP1wt/GATA2m (46.3 %, p = 0.1). Among SETBP1m/GATA2m, 77.8 % of patients had 
SRSF2 co-mutation, compared to 44.8 % among SETBP1m/GATA2wt (p = 0.08), and 
27.8 % among SETBP1wt/GATA2m (p = 0.006). AML progression frequency for non-AML 
cases did not significantly differ between the 3 groups. Survival of 
SETBP1m/GATA2m patients was not worse compared to SETBP1wt/GATA2m or 
SETBP1m/GATA2wt.

The landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) diagnosis 
is evolving rapidly, driven by advances in disease understanding, biomarker 
tools, and disease-modifying therapies. Modern diagnostic approaches emphasize 
biological precision, early detection, and dynamic frameworks that adapt to 
treatment-induced changes in disease biology. These frameworks enable 
opportunities for personalized interventions-encompassing pharmacological and 
non-pharmacological strategies-and for enhanced clinical trial design. However, 
implementing these advancements globally is influenced by diverse cultural, 
infrastructural, and regulatory factors. The 2024 Alzheimer's Association 
International Conference Advancements: Modernizing Diagnosis, held in Japan, 
provided a unique platform to explore these global dynamics, particularly from 
an Asian perspective. This article highlights key discussions from the 
conference, exploring the role of biomarker-based diagnostic frameworks in 
shaping the future of AD/ADRD research, diagnosis, and treatment. We highlight 
regional challenges and successes and emphasize ethical considerations and 
practical strategies needed to ensure equitable access to diagnostic and 
therapeutic innovations. HIGHLIGHTS: Advances in biomarkers are reshaping 
Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and treatment. Modern diagnostic frameworks 
highlight biological precision, early detection, and dynamic frameworks. The 
2024 Alzheimer's Association International Conference Advancements: Modernizing 
Diagnosis explored challenges and opportunities in global biomarker 
implementation. The conference explored geographic-specific impacts, focusing on 
Asia.

BACKGROUND: Molecular imaging, particularly positron emission tomography (PET), 
has significantly advanced the diagnosis and management of disease by 
visualizing biological processes at a cellular and molecular level. PET imaging 
of the brain, spine, and head/neck, summarized under the umbrella term 
Neuro-PET, enables noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring of diseases such as 
dementia, epilepsy, cancer, movement, or autoimmune disorders. The rising 
prevalence of these conditions, as well as new treatment options necessitating 
response assessment, are expected to escalate Neuro-PET imaging volumes, with 
projections for a significant increase in the need for specialized imaging 
services. This increasing clinical need highlights existing workforce shortages 
and underscores the need for neuroradiologists to acquire proficiency in 
molecular imaging. This expanded role seeks to address the growing demand. To 
this end, we propose a rigorous, structured, patient-centered, and collaborative 
framework for expanding neuroradiologists' training and practice to include 
Neuro-PET interpretation.
METHODS: This ASNR consensus statement outlines competency recommendations, 
training pathways, and implementation strategies to incorporate Neuro-PET into 
neuroradiology practice. This approach is based on existing guidelines and was 
informed by survey data from neuroradiologists and molecular imaging 
subspecialists revealing current practice patterns and training needs. For 
neuroradiology fellows, structured training encompasses hands-on Neuro-PET 
imaging experience, understanding the biologic and molecular basis of 
radiopharmaceuticals used in Neuro-PET, and integrating molecular insights with 
anatomical data. Neuroradiologists beyond fellowship can undertake 
practice-based curriculum involving supervised case interpretation, standardized 
reader training courses, continuing medical education (CME), and peer review.
KEY MESSAGE: Neuroradiologists, with their in-depth expertise of central nervous 
system structure and function, are well positioned to meld molecular imaging 
data with traditional anatomical findings. They can achieve competency and 
should be granted practice privileges in interpreting Neuro-PET studies through 
a comprehensive combination of structured training, hands-on clinical 
experience, and documented CME hours.

education; ACR= American College of Radiology.

The risk of periprocedural stroke with TAVR remains a significant concern. 
Cerebral embolic protection (CEP) devices have been developed to mitigate this 
risk, but their clinical benefit remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the 
effectiveness and safety of routine CEP use during TAVR through a meta-analysis 
of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, 
and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted from inception to May 22, 2025, to identify 
RCTs comparing CEP versus standard care during TAVR. The primary outcome was 
stroke (including disabling and nondisabling strokes). Secondary outcomes 
included disabling stroke, new ischemic lesions on post-TAVR brain magnetic 
resonance imaging, all-cause mortality, major vascular complications, 
life-threatening bleeding, and acute kidney injury. Risk ratios (RRs) were 
pooled using a random-effects model. A total of 9 RCTs encompassing 11,641 
patients (5970 with CEP and 5671 without) were included. CEP use did not 
significantly reduce the risk of stroke (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.73-1.14; P=.41), 
disabling stroke (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.57-1.12; P=.19), or new ischemic lesions 
on magnetic resonance imaging (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91-1.06; P=.64). There were 
no significant differences in all-cause mortality or safety outcomes between the 
CEP and control groups. Subgroup analyses based on the type of CEP device showed 
no significant differences in outcomes between the 2 groups, regardless of 
device type. In conclusion, routine CEP use during TAVR was not associated with 
reductions in stroke, disabling stroke, or all-cause mortality. Future studies 
are warranted to identify subgroups that may benefit from selective CEP use.

BACKGROUND: A significant proportion of patients requiring mitral valve (MV) 
intervention have undergone prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). 
Reoperative heart surgery is associated with increased risk.
AIMS: To evaluate the utilization and outcomes of transcatheter vs. surgical MV 
interventions in patients with prior CABG.
METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Readmission Database (2016-21) to identify 
adults with prior CABG hospitalized for transcatheter or surgical MV 
intervention. In-hospital outcomes were compared using multivariable regression 
and propensity-matching analyses. Readmissions were compared using Cox 
proportional hazards regression model.
RESULTS: Of 305 625 weighted hospitalizations for MV intervention, 23 506 (7.7%) 
occurred in patients with prior CABG. From 2016Q1-2021Q4, the use of 
transcatheter MV interventions increased among patients with prior CABG (72 to 
191 for repair and 6 to 45 for replacement per 100 000 hospitalizations, both 
ptrend < 0.001). Compared with surgical MV repair and replacement, transcatheter 
MV repair and replacement were associated with similar in-hospital mortality 
(adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-1.03 for 
repair; aOR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-1.02 for replacement) and 180-day heart failure 
(HF) readmissions (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.56, 95% CI 0.85-2.87 for 
repair; aHR 1.15, 95% CI 0.63-2.09 for replacement) and lower stroke, acute 
kidney injury, permanent pacemaker placement, length of stay, and non-home 
discharges, respectively. Vascular complications were higher with transcatheter 
vs. surgical MV replacement.
CONCLUSION: Transcatheter MV interventions are increasingly used as the 
preferred modality of MV intervention in patients with prior CABG and are 
associated with similar in-hospital mortality and 180-day HF readmissions 
compared with surgical MV interventions.

Patients with resectable Ewing sarcoma (ES) in select sites, such as the pelvis 
or chest wall, have a higher risk of positive microscopic margins following 
surgery. AEWS1031 was the first North American/Australasia ES cooperative group 
trial allowing standardized preoperative radiotherapy, intended to minimize the 
morbidity of combined modality local tumor control as well as improve the 
likelihood of clear surgical margins. In this study, we found that the use of 
low-dose preoperative radiation to a smaller target volume resulted in a high 
rate of R0 resection. The robust pathologic response rate strengthens existing 
evidence illustrating the radiosensitivity of Ewing sarcoma.

Rochester, MN.

Increased participation in youth sports has led to a corresponding increase in 
throwing-related injuries among skeletally immature athletes. These injuries 
often stem from overuse and can in part be attributed to sport specialization 
leading to year-round sport participation without adequate rest and an increase 
in volume of practices and games during the season. Injuries that occur in 
skeletally immature athletes can be unique to this population due to the 
vulnerability of the open growth plates. Common injuries include Little League 
shoulder (proximal humeral epiphysiolysis), internal impingement of the 
shoulder, Little League elbow, medial ulnar collateral ligament injuries, and 
capitellar osteochondral defects. Diagnosis and management of these injuries 
requires a high index of suspicion from the treating physician. In addition, 
prevention strategies and pitching guidelines have been introduced to decrease 
the burden of injury on this population. Proper treatment, appropriate 
intervention, and a thorough understanding of injury prevention guidelines can 
allow these young athletes to undergo a timely recovery and return to sport 
participation with minimal long-term effect.

Registration is the process of spatially and/or temporally aligning different 
images. It is a critical tool that can facilitate the automatic tracking of 
pathological changes detected in radiological images and align images captured 
by different imaging systems and/or those acquired using different acquisition 
parameters. The longitudinal analysis of clinical changes has a significant role 
in helping clinicians evaluate disease progression and determine the most 
suitable course of treatment for patients. This study provides a comprehensive 
review of the role registration-based approaches play in automated change 
tracking in radiological imaging and explores the three types of registration 
approaches which include rigid, affine, and nonrigid registration, as well as 
methods of detecting and quantifying changes in registered longitudinal images: 
the intensity-based approach and the deformation-based approach. After providing 
an overview and background, we highlight the clinical applications of these 
methods, specifically focusing on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) in tumors and multiple sclerosis (MS), two of the most 
heavily studied areas in automated change tracking. We conclude with a 
discussion and recommendation for future directions.

BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood cancer face excess risk of developing basal 
cell carcinoma (BCC). Age-specific BCC risk prediction models for survivors may 
support targeted screening recommendations.
METHODS: We developed models predicting BCC risk by ages 40 and 50 years 
featuring detailed cancer treatment predictors, utilizing statistical/machine 
learning algorithms and data from 23,166 five-year survivors in the Childhood 
Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study. 
Selected models were externally validated in 5,314 survivors in the St Jude 
Lifetime Cohort (SJLIFE). Model discrimination and precision were evaluated 
using the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and 
precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and benchmarked against the current Children's 
Oncology Group Long-Term Follow-Up Guidelines (COG LTFU, v6.0) for skin cancer 
screening.
RESULTS: By ages 40 and 50 years, BCC cumulative incidence was 5% and 15% in 
CCSS and 7% and 21% in SJLIFE. The XGBoost algorithm-based models with treatment 
dose-specific predictors performed best, showing good external discrimination 
(AUROC40y=0.75; AUROC50y=0.76) and precision (AUPRC40y=0.20; AUPRC50y=0.52), 
outperforming COG LTFU Guideline-directed risk stratification (AUROC40y=0.65, 
AUROC50y=0.62; AUPRC40y=0.09, AUPRC50y=0.26; P < .01). These novel models 
reclassified 37% of survivors with COG-recommended skin cancer screening as low 
risk by age 40 and 29% of survivors without COG-recommended screening as 
moderate/high risk by age 50, suggesting these recommendations overestimate risk 
in younger survivors and miss relevant predictors (eg, attained age, 
chemotherapy).
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we present validated BCC risk prediction models for 
childhood cancer survivors that outperform current practice guidelines. The 
associated online risk calculator can inform risk-/age-based screening 
recommendations.

More than 57 million people globally suffer from neurodegenerative diseases, a 
figure expected to double every 20 years. Despite this growing burden, there are 
currently no cures, and treatment options remain limited due to disease 
heterogeneity, prolonged preclinical and prodromal phases, poor understanding of 
disease mechanisms, and diagnostic challenges. Identifying novel biomarkers is 
crucial for improving early detection, prognosis, staging and subtyping of these 
conditions. High-dimensional molecular studies in biofluids ('omics') offer 
promise for scalable biomarker discovery, but challenges in assembling large, 
diverse datasets hinder progress. To address this, the Global Neurodegeneration 
Proteomics Consortium (GNPC)-a public-private partnership-established one of the 
world's largest harmonized proteomic datasets. It includes approximately 250 
million unique protein measurements from multiple platforms from more than 
35,000 biofluid samples (plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid) contributed by 
23 partners, alongside associated clinical data spanning Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS). This dataset is accessible to GNPC members via the 
Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative's AD Workbench, a secure cloud-based 
environment, and will be available to the wider research community on 15 July 
2025. Here we present summary analyses of the plasma proteome revealing 
disease-specific differential protein abundance and transdiagnostic proteomic 
signatures of clinical severity. Furthermore, we describe a robust plasma 
proteomic signature of APOE ε4 carriership, reproducible across AD, PD, FTD and 
ALS, as well as distinct patterns of organ aging across these conditions. This 
work demonstrates the power of international collaboration, data sharing and 
open science to accelerate discovery in neurodegeneration research.

Role of stretching interventions in enhancing the shoulder range of motion in 
overhead athletes with glenohumeral internal rotation deficit: A systematic 
review and meta-analysis.

OBJECTIVE: Sleeper stretching (SS) and cross-body stretching (CS) are common 
nonsurgical interventions for the management of glenohumeral internal rotation 
deficit (GIRD) in overhead athletes such as baseball and volleyball players. 
However, the effectiveness of these stretching interventions in enhancing the 
range of motion (ROM) of shoulder internal rotation (IR) in overhead athletes 
with GIRD remains a subject of uncertainty. This systematic review and 
meta-analysis aim to critically assess the efficacy of SS and CS in the ROM of 
the IR among overhead athletes with GIRD, thereby providing evidence-based 
recommendations for their use.
LITERATURE SURVEY: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Scopus 
databases up to November 2024 was conducted to identify randomized controlled 
trials investigating the influence of SS and CS on the ROM of shoulder IR in 
overhead athletes with GIRD.
METHODOLOGY: Data including study characteristics and outcomes were extracted. 
Risk of bias assessment and random-effects model meta-analysis were performed.
SYNTHESIS: Six eligible studies involving 255 athletes with GIRD were included. 
The meta-analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences between 
stretching and control groups in terms of enhancing the ROM of IR (mean 
difference [MD], 7°; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1°-13°; p = .02) and 
horizontal adduction (HAD) ([MD], 6°; [CI], 1°-11°; p = .03).
CONCLUSION: SS or combination of SS and CS interventions significantly enhanced 
the ROM of IR compared to the control group in overhead athletes diagnosed with 
GIRD. Furthermore, the review confirmed that SS alone also markedly enhances the 
ROM of HAD. These findings highlight the potential benefits of SS and CS in 
managing GIRD and suggest a need for further research to optimize these 
interventions for broader application in overhead athletes.

Utility of HFpEF Diagnostic Scores to Stratify Cardiac Reserve Among Patients 
With Dyspnea.

BACKGROUND: The heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) scores 
were initially developed to facilitate diagnosis of HFpEF in patients with 
dyspnea. Whether these diagnostic scores also relate to severity of 
cardiopulmonary reserve limitations across the broad range of patients with 
dyspnea, with or without confirmed HFpEF, remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between 
HFpEF scores and disease severity in patients with dyspnea.
METHODS: Patients undergoing invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing for 
unexplained dyspnea were studied. Cardiac structure, function, and 
cardiopulmonary reserve were compared based on H2FPEF, HFA-PEFF, and HFpEF-ABA 
scores.
RESULTS: A total of 1,130 subjects were included in this study, of whom 902 had 
HFpEF and 228 had noncardiac dyspnea. Patients were categorized by HFpEF-ABA 
score into low (probability <25%, n = 91), intermediate (probability 25%-80%, n 
= 559), and high HFpEF probabilities (probability >80%, n = 480). Patients with 
high HFpEF-ABA score exhibited more severe structural and functional 
abnormalities characteristic of HFpEF, across virtually all morphological and 
functional indices, as well as hemodynamic and cardiopulmonary indices. Similar 
findings were observed using the H2FPEF and HFA-PEFF scores, and when analyses 
were restricted to those with HFpEF or to those with noncardiac dyspnea.
CONCLUSIONS: The HFpEF scores stratify the extent of cardiac dysfunction, 
hemodynamic severity, and functional limitation in a broad cohort of individuals 
with chronic dyspnea, across the overall cohort and within individuals with or 
without HFpEF. These data indicate that HFpEF probability scores may also be 
used as markers of disease severity and preclinical HFpEF.

In 2017, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation) working group defined the certainty of evidence as the certainty 
that the true effect lies on one side of a threshold or in a particular range. 
This definition has proved useful as the basis for rating certainty, 
facilitating the interpretation of the results for the target audience. However, 
the categorization of suggested thresholds and ranges as levels of 
contextualization led to inconsistencies between the initial and subsequent 
papers and has proved confusing for some GRADE users. Although considering 
context in choosing thresholds remains worthwhile, the GRADE working group will 
no longer use the categorization of contextualization. It will instead refer 
simply to chosen thresholds or ranges for determining the target of certainty 
rating.

ObjectiveCognitive impairment is increasingly recognized in patients with 
cerebral venous congestion (CVC), yet the cognitive tools used are largely 
adapted from stroke and dementia research. This review examines current 
literature on cognitive function in CVC, including conditions such as cerebral 
venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), and 
dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVFs). Special emphasis is placed on the 
limitations of common screening tools like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
(MoCA) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Cognitive dysfunction-primarily 
affecting executive function, processing speed, and attention-is reported in up 
to 86% of CVC cases, yet only about 20% of studies use validated cognitive 
testing tools, most of which may lack sensitivity for CVC-specific deficits. 
Emerging techniques such as ocular motor testing and physiological markers show 
promise but require further validation. There is an urgent need for 
standardized, CVC-specific cognitive assessment protocols that reflect the 
unique pathophysiology of venous disorders. Future research should prioritize 
the development of targeted cognitive batteries and integrate objective 
physiological measures to enhance diagnostic accuracy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment trends and compare outcomes following 
fenestrated-branched endovascular aortic repair (FB-EVAR) versus open surgical 
repair (OSR) of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA).
BACKGROUND: FB-EVAR has been increasingly utilized as a less invasive 
alternative to OSR for treatment of TAAAs.
METHODS: We studied patients who underwent elective FB-EVAR or OSR of TAAAs 
(2008-2020), since the initiation of an Advanced Endovascular Aortic Program. 
Primary endpoints were early major adverse events (MAE) and early and late 
all-cause mortality. Propensity score overlap weighting analysis was performed 
to adjust for measured confounders between groups.
RESULTS: There were 357 (70.8%) patients treated by FB-EVAR and 147 (29.2%) with 
OSR. The use of FB-EVAR increased from 16.7% in 2008 to >80% since 2017 
(P<0.001). Incidences of early MAEs were 25.8% and 49.0%, respectively; early 
mortality rates for FB-EVAR and OSR were 2.5% and 6.8%, respectively. In the 
weighted cohort, FB-EVAR patients had decreased early MAEs (weight-adjusted odds 
ratio [aOR], 0.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-0.41; P<0.001) and 
mortality (aOR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.73; P=0.005) versus OSR patients. Five-year 
survival estimates were 52.2% (95% CI, 45.2-60.4%) and 78.0% (95% CI, 
70.6-86.2%), respectively. In the weighted cohort, there was no significant 
difference in late survival between groups (weight-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.33; 
95% CI, 0.74-2.39; P=0.34).
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the change in practice from OSR to FB-EVAR for 
treatment of TAAAs over the past decade. Incidences of early MAEs and mortality 
were lower with FB-EVAR, with no significant difference in late survival in the 
weighted cohort.

INTRODUCTION: We investigated associations of plasma proteins with blood-based 
amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration/inflammation (A/T/N/I) biomarkers for Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: Plasma proteomics and clinical data from the Indiana AD Research Center 
(N = 498) were used. Association analysis of plasma proteins with blood A/T/N/I 
biomarkers as well as diagnosis was performed, followed by replication in an 
independent cohort (N = 323), network analysis, pathway enrichment, and machine 
learning classification to identify proteins and pathways related to AD risk.
RESULTS: We identified 35 proteins associated with AD, 20 of which were 
replicated in the independent cohort. We identified 150, 448, and 219 proteins 
associated with T/N/I biomarkers, respectively, revealing biomarker-specific 
pathways. Network analysis identified two modules associated with T/N/I 
biomarkers, preserved in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and their enriched pathways. 
The classification model of proteins effectively differentiated AD (area under 
the curve [AUC] = 0.930).
CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest dysregulated plasma proteins and pathways in 
AD, enhancing our understanding of molecular mechanisms and diagnostic 
strategies for AD.
HIGHLIGHTS: Plasma proteins were identified as being associated with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and plasma biomarkers. The identified proteins were replicated in 
both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics. The identified proteins 
were associated with AD biomarker-specific pathways. The identified proteins 
improved the performance of the AD classification. Protein network analysis 
identified network modules and their enriched pathways.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The most common cause of convexity subarachnoid 
hemorrhage (cSAH) in younger patients (younger than 60 years) is reversible 
cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS). Evidence on the long-term outcomes of 
future vascular events and functional outcome after cSAH due to RCVS is limited. 
We aimed to assess the rates and baseline predictors of our primary outcomes 
(cSAH, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and ischemic stroke), functional outcome, 
and mortality after cSAH attributed to RCVS.
METHODS: Individual patient data pooled analysis in patients with cSAH 
attributed to RCVS. A systematic literature search was conducted in PubMed and 
EMBASE. Two independent reviewers screened studies and extracted data. Quality 
assessment was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Early events during 
the accepted time frame of an RCVS episode (<3 months) were classified as 
progression rather than recurrence. Follow-up was truncated at 5 years. Primary 
outcomes were recurrent cSAH, ICH, and ischemic stroke. Secondary outcomes were 
mortality and functional status measured by modified Rankin Score (mRS).
RESULTS: We identified 21 eligible cohorts finally including 138 patients from 9 
collaborative centers, which provided individual patient data. The mean age was 
49.3 ± 12.1 years, and 110 (79.7%) were female. During a mean follow-up of 1.8 
years, annual rates were cSAH recurrence 0.81% (95% CI 0.1-2.91), ICH 0.81% (95% 
CI 0.1-2.91), and ischemic stroke 0.81% (95% CI 0.1-2.91). Progression during 
the initial episode (shortly after admission) occurred in 10 patients for cSAH, 
2 for ICH, and 8 for ischemic stroke, respectively. Of 106 patients (76.8%) with 
available outcome data, 100 (94.3%) achieve a mRS of ≤1 at follow-up, indicating 
no significant disability. Two patients died (annual rate 0.5%, 95% CI 
0.09-2.9): one within 10 days and the other within 2 months of the cSAH.
DISCUSSION: Our data suggest a favorable prognosis for most patients after 
RCVS-associated cSAH with low rates of recurrent events and a high proportion 
achieving functional independence. Major limitations include retrospective data 
collection and potential selection bias from centers providing individual 
patient data. Nevertheless, these findings provide prognostic information to 
inform clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Most existing literature on predictors of myelin oligodendrocyte 
glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) relapse predates the 2023 
diagnostic criteria and have yielded mixed results. While prolonged 
corticosteroid use has been shown to reduce relapse rates in some studies, the 
optimal dose and duration remain unclear.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of patients treated for MOGAD at the 
University of Utah and Primary Children's Hospital who met the 2023 diagnostic 
criteria and either experienced a relapse or were followed for ≥12 months after 
the initial attack. A multivariable Andersen-Gill model assessed clinical and 
treatment factors associated with relapse risk. Corticosteroid doses were 
converted to prednisone equivalents, with duration defined by the period on 
≥12.5 mg/day (≥0.16 mg/kg/day in pediatric patients).
RESULTS: Seventy-two patients were included (median onset age 25.5 [IQR 
11.75-46.5] years; of these, 47 [65.3 %] female; 30 [41.7 %] pediatric). 
Twenty-five (34.7 %) experienced at least one relapse. Optic neuritis was more 
common among adults (81 % vs. 56.7 %, p = 0.049), whereas acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis was more frequent among pediatric patients (33.3 % vs. 2.4 %, 
p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that corticosteroids ≥12 weeks (HR 
0.298, 95 % CI 0.1-0.887, p = 0.03) and maintenance immunotherapy (HR 0.061, 
95 % CI 0.016-0.229, p < 0.001) were associated with lower relapse risk. 
Sensitivity analysis showed that both rituximab (HR 0.099, 95 % CI 0.024-0.407, 
p = 0.001) and maintenance IVIg (HR 0.058, 95 % CI 0.007-0.471, p = 0.008) were 
independently associated with reduced relapse risk.
CONCLUSION: Prolonged corticosteroid therapy for ≥12 weeks and maintenance 
immunotherapy with rituximab or intravenous immunoglobulin independently lower 
relapse risk in MOGAD.

BACKGROUND: There are no FDA-approved treatments for anti-N-methyl-d-aspartate 
receptor encephalitis (NMDARE), and no prospective, multicenter clinical trials 
have been completed to provide evidence for management of this disease. We 
evaluated changes in treatment strategies and outcomes since the previous 
comprehensive review in 2019.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed capturing 
manuscripts published from January 2019 through March 2024. Demographic and 
clinical data were extracted from articles containing individual immunotherapy 
data in NMDARE and were compared to a previously published literature review. 
Studies with ≥10 cases, ≥6 months follow-up, and outcomes reported as favorable 
(modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0-2) and poor (mRS 3-5 or 3-6), were grouped and 
summarized by diagnosis period.
RESULTS: Among 649 patients from 321 articles, first- (from 91.3 % to 98.3 %, 
p < 0.001) and second-line (from 31.8 % to 42.5 %, p < 0.001) immunotherapy use 
has increased. The proportion of patients receiving immunotherapy within 30 days 
of symptom onset increased from 50.1 % to 72.5 % (p < 0.001). Favorable outcome 
(mRS 0-2) increased from 71.5 % to 76.7 % (p = 0.024), while mortality (6.3 % to 
6.9 %, p = 0.714) and relapse rates (12.6 % vs. 13.2 %, p = 0.789) remained 
unchanged. Data from larger cohort studies of patients diagnosed with NMDARE 
after 2013 have reported wide variability in the proportion of patients 
achieving a favorable outcome at final follow-up, ranging from 56 % to 93 %, 
depending on the institution and follow-up duration.
CONCLUSIONS: Since 2019, more patients have been treated early with first- and 
second-line immunotherapies. Functional outcomes have shown modest improvements,

BACKGROUND: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating 
syndrome observed in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated 
disease (MOGAD) but there are limited data on application of this definition to 
its cerebral attacks or in adults with this disease.
METHODS: We analyzed patients from the Mayo Clinic MOGAD cohort (n = 263) with 
cerebral attacks. We assessed whether children (<18 years-old) and adults 
(⩾18 years-old) fulfilled the 2013 ADEM definition.
RESULTS: We identified 89 patients (children, 34; adults, 55) and 55/89 (62%) 
were of female sex. Acute magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities 
included: poorly demarcated T2 lesions (white matter, 85 (96%); deep gray 
matter, 41 (46%); T1-hypointense lesions (42 (47%)). Forty-two patients did not 
fulfill the ADEM definition due to: monofocal syndrome, 9; or no encephalopathy, 
33. The remaining 47 patients (53%: children, 27/34 (79%); adults, 20/55 (36%)) 
fulfilled the ADEM definition, and 14 had preceding attacks, and 34 had 
subsequent attacks relative to ADEM episode. The features in children and adults 
with ADEM were broadly comparable.
CONCLUSION: Applying the ADEM definition to MOGAD cerebral attacks highlighted 
that an update of the 2013 ADEM definition would be beneficial and could 
explicitly state its application to both adults and children and allow it to be 
applied to attacks at any time during the disease course.

Although animal studies have linked cellular senescence to the pathogenesis and 
complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), there is a paucity of 
corroborating data in humans. Thus, we measured a previously validated marker 
for senescent cell burden in humans, T-cell expression of p16 mRNA, along with 
additional biomarkers, to compare the senescence phenotypes of postmenopausal 
control (lean, N = 37) and T2DM (N = 27) participants. To control for effects of 
obesity alone, we included a third group of obese but non-diabetic women 
(N = 29) who were matched for body mass index to the T2DM participants. In 
addition, given the increase in fracture risk in T2DM despite preserved or even 
increased bone mineral density, we related these senescence biomarkers in the 
T2DM participants to skeletal microarchitectural parameters. Relative to the 
lean participants, T-cell p16 and p21Cip1 expression was increased in the T2DM, 
but not the obese, non-diabetic participants. Expression of p16 and p21Cip1 was 
positively associated with HbA1c and an index of skin advanced glycation 
end-products. T2DM was also associated with an increase in a number of SASP 
factors. Among participants with T2DM, women in the highest tertile for T-cell 
expression of p16 had significantly reduced tibial cortical area and thickness 
as compared to those in the lower two tertiles. Overall, our studies link 
cellular senescence to metabolic and skeletal alterations in T2DM and point to 
the need for further studies evaluating the role of cellular senescence in 
mediating skeletal fragility, as well as potentially other complications in 
T2DM.

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease mainly prevalent in older people. A hip 
fracture, its most devastating complication, is associated with a one in five 
chance of mortality in the first year. This review discusses emerging risk 
factors for bone fragility including diabetes, sarcopenia, and bariatric 
surgery. Recency of fracture represents an imminent risk that deserves prompt 
recognition. The new FRAXplus calculator accounts for additional risk factors to 
refine existing risk stratification. Advances in imaging techniques such as 
trabecular bone score and radiofrequency echographic multi-spectrometry may have 
potential roles in specific populations. Treatment of osteoporosis requires a 
multifaceted approach. Non-drug interventions include fall prevention and 
resistance exercises, supplementation with calcium, vitamin D and possibly 
vitamin K, and effective bridging of care gaps with fracture liaison services. 
An overview of drug therapy is provided, drawing attention to the importance of 
sequential therapy starting with potent anabolic agents for the patients at the 
highest risk, as opposed to a traditional step-up approach. An individualized, 
goal directed care plan is necessary for a treat-to-target approach, with total 
hip bone mineral density being the best specific target. Future research in 
cellular senescence points to the role of senolytics and senomorphics to 
alleviate osteoporosis, among other age related conditions.

CONTEXT: Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), a paraneoplastic disorder 
characterized by renal phosphate wasting, is cured by surgical removal of the 
culprit tumor. Despite correct localization, some remain refractory to 
intervention, resulting in substantial long-term medical complications.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to identify risk factors associated with a refractory outcome.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort of 44 patients with TIO diagnosed from 
1998 to 2023 who underwent targeted intervention following successfully 
localization. Cure was defined as maintenance of normophosphatemia without 
supplementation for ≥1 month, maintained at last follow-up.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients achieved cure and 15 had a refractory outcome. On 
univariate Cox regression, the HR for predicting cure was 3.43 (95% CI 
1.45-8.11, P = .005) for patients diagnosed after 2013 (compared to before), and 
that for a negative surgical tumor margin was 2.56 (95% CI 1.20-5.45, P = .015) 
compared to positive/unspecified margins. After adjustment for year of 
diagnosis, tumors originating from soft tissue (HR 2.72 vs bone, 95% CI 
1.22-6.09, P = .015) or located outside the spine (HR 0.22 for spine vs 
nonspine, 95% CI 0.05-0.96, P = .043) had higher chances of cure. Size of tumor, 
age, gender, or baseline biochemistry including levels of fibroblast growth 
factor (FGF)23, phosphorus, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or alkaline phosphatase 
were not predictive of cure. Postprocedural FGF23 was the best biochemical 
marker of cure (area under curve 0.899, 95% CI 0.764-1.00, P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Tumors diagnosed within the past decade with clear resection margins 
had more favorable prognoses. With regards to tumoral factors, baseline 
biochemistry was uninformative in predicting cure, while bone and/or spine 
localizations were associated with a refractory outcome.

OBJECTIVES: Goreisan is a Japanese herbal medicine composed of five active 
ingredients and is believed to exert its effects by inhibiting various 
aquaporins. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the 
effectiveness of Goreisan in the postoperative management of chronic subdural 
hematoma (CSDH).
METHODS: This review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and 
included studies evaluating Goreisan for the postoperative management of CSDH. 
PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Google Scholar were queried to identify 
studies that met our criteria from their inception to December 2024. Symptomatic 
recurrence was the primary outcome; heterogeneity was not assessed beyond this 
endpoint.
RESULTS: Eleven studies (five randomized controlled trials and six retrospective 
studies) with 9443 patients (4809 received Goreisan and 4634 did not receive 
Goreisan postoperatively) were included in the analyses. The symptomatic 
recurrence rate was significantly lower in the Goreisan group compared to the 
control group (276 of 4,809 patients [5.7%] vs. 345 of 4,634 [7.4%]; odds ratio, 
0.69 [95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.86]) with I2 = 13%. AEs were reported 
in seven studies: five studies reported no AEs related to Goreisan, while two 
studies reported pollakiuria (1%) and unspecified AEs (1%). An exploratory cost 
comparison also indicated that the cost of postoperative Goreisan ($15-18) was 
substantially lower than that of burr hole drainage ($694) or middle meningeal 
artery embolization ($1,304).
DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrated that Goreisan is effective in preventing 
symptomatic recurrence in postoperative CSDH cases. (PROSPERO number 
CRD42025645208.).

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence 
(AI)-enhanced electrocardiography (ECG; AI-ECG) algorithm to predict atrial 
fibrillation (AF) detection on prolonged cardiac monitoring (PCM) after index 
stroke.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all adult patients with 
ischemic stroke evaluated at Mayo Clinic with baseline ECG and PCM from January 
1, 2018, to December 31, 2020. We recorded demographic characteristics, clinical 
features, presumed stroke mechanism, PCM duration, and PCM outcome (AF vs no AF) 
and AF burden. Electrocardiograms were analyzed using the AI-ECG algorithm to 
determine likelihood of AF capture with PCM. Stroke etiology was adjudicated 
using TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) and embolic stroke of 
undetermined source (ESUS) definitions. The ability of the AI-ECG algorithm to 
predict AF detected by PCM was assessed via receiver operating characteristics 
analysis, calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
(C statistic). Sensitivity and specificity analyses were performed for each tool 
using optimal cutoffs (using maximum Youden indices).
RESULTS: We identified 863 patients for inclusion in the study. The median age 
was 69 years, 496 (57.5%) were male, 367 (42.5%) were women, and 561 patients 
(65.0%) were categorized as having ESUS. Prolonged cardiac monitoring detected 
AF in 85 patients (9.8%). Median duration of PCM was 30 days (IQR, 25 to 30 
days). The AI-ECG algorithm identified a notable difference in probability of AF 
on PCM. For its optimal model output cutoff of 0.24, AI-ECG had a negative 
predictive value of 94.2% (95% CI, 92.2% to 95.9%) and a specificity of 81.8% 
(95% CI, 78.9% to 84.4%) for excluding AF on PCM. When evaluating for an AF 
burden of 6 minutes or longer, the AI-ECG had a negative predictive value of 
96.7% (95% CI, 95.5% to 97.6%). There was no significant difference in the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve when comparing the ESUS vs 
non-ESUS subgroups (P=.42).
CONCLUSION: This study found that AI-ECG may help identify patients unlikely to 
have AF on PCM and can predict the occurrence of longer episodes of AF. Thus, 
AI-ECG may be used to stratify which patients should undergo PCM after stroke. 
Future studies should compare the performance of AI-ECG and PCM for the clinical 
end point of stroke recurrence.

BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic preoperative opioid use may have worse 
outcomes after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) than opioid-naïve patients. This 
study aimed to determine if patients who fill opioid prescriptions before TJA 
are more likely to have a social determinants of health deficit (SDHD).
METHODS: This study included a retrospective, single-institution cohort of 
patients undergoing TJA for osteoarthritis. Opioid prescription information was 
queried from a national drug monitoring database and patients were classified as 
preoperative opioid users if they had at least one filled opioid prescription 
from one to 30 days and from 31 to 90 days preoperatively, and naïve patients 
were those who did not have a filled prescription in the year before surgery. 
Patients were divided by procedure type (total hip arthroplasty [THA] or total 
knee arthroplasty [TKA]) and each group was matched 3:1 by demographics. Social 
determinants of health identified included living alone, transportation access, 
race and ethnicity, insurance type, social vulnerability index (SVI), and area 
deprivation index (ADI). After matching, 519 opioid-using THA patients were 
compared with 1,557 naïve THA patients, and 399 opioid-using TKA patients were 
compared with 1,197 naïve TKA patients.
RESULTS: Opioid-using patients were significantly more likely to not be 
employed, to have non-commercial insurance, have a psychiatric disorder, and to 
live alone. Opioid-using TKA patients were significantly more likely to lack 
transportation access, and opioid-using THA patients were significantly more 
likely to be Black. Opioid-using patients for both groups also had significantly 
higher vulnerability scores in the national ADI and across all SVI categories 
than naïve patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients using opioids preoperatively are more likely to have an 
SDHD compared to opioid-naïve patients, which may indicate differences in 
pathways of care in patients who have SDHD undergoing TJA and further highlights 
the influence SDHD can have on patient outcomes following TJA.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is an 
alternative to long-term anticoagulation for preventing ischemic stroke in 
patients with atrial fibrillation. There are limited long-term outcomes data for 
"real-world" patients undergoing LAAO.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National 
Cardiovascular Data Registry LAAO registry from January 1, 2016, through 
December 31, 2019. We linked LAAO data to inpatient Medicare fee-for-service 
claims data using probabilistic matching to establish a cohort of patients 
65 years and older undergoing LAAO with a WATCHMAN device. The primary outcomes 
were any stroke and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 34 975 patients with a mean±SD CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive 
heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes, previous stroke or 
transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, and sex 
category) score of 4.7±1.4 were included. The median follow-up was 2.8 years 
(interquartile range, 2.2-3.7 years). The cumulative incidence of any stroke was 
1.57 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.45-1.70), with a 1-year and 5-year any 
stroke estimate of 1.70% (95% CI, 1.57-1.84%) and 5.70% (95% CI, 5.37-6.05%), 
respectively. The cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was 1.36 per 100 
person-years (95% CI, 1.25-1.48), with a 1-year and 5-year ischemic stroke 
estimate of 1.42% (95% CI, 1.30-1.54%) and 5.03% (95% CI, 4.71-5.36%), 
respectively. The cumulative incidence of death was 10.82 per 100 person-years 
(95% CI, 10.49-11.13), with a 5-year mortality estimate of 44.34% (95% CI, 
43.35-45.23%).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term stroke rates in a large nationally representative cohort 
of Medicare patients following LAAO were low and durably consistent during 
long-term follow-up despite a high thromboembolic risk. High mortality rates in 
this elderly population underscore the importance of incorporating patient 
values and preferences when considering LAAO.

PURPOSE: Neoadjuvant ± adjuvant immunotherapy improves event-free survival (EFS) 
versus adjuvant immunotherapy alone for high-risk resectable Stage III melanoma. 
However, the optimal regimen balancing efficacy and tolerability is unknown. 
T-cell immunoglobulin and ITIM domain (TIGIT) is a promising immune checkpoint 
whose therapeutic potential in Stage III melanoma is underexplored.
METHODS: In this phase II trial, patients with resectable, macroscopic Stage III 
melanoma received four 21-day neoadjuvant cycles of 1200 mg IV atezolizumab 
(anti-PD-L1) + 600 mg IV tiragolumab (anti-TIGIT), therapeutic lymph node 
dissection (TLND) and eight adjuvant cycles of atezolizumab. Primary endpoints 
were pathologic response and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after TLND in 
patients receiving adjuvant therapy; secondary and exploratory endpoints 
included adverse events (AEs), EFS and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients initiated neoadjuvant atezolizumab/tiragolumab and 
were evaluable for AEs, pathologic response and EFS. 76.5 % had > 1 metastatic 
lymph node at baseline and 73.5 % were Stage IIIC. Thirty patients had per 
protocol TLND. Major pathologic responses (MPR, ≤10 % viable tumor) were 
observed in 16/34 patients (47.1 %). With 19.9 months median follow-up, 12-month 
EFS was 72.0 % (95 %CI 57.9-89.5 %), 12-month RFS was 73.3 % (95 %CI 
56.9-94.5 %), and 12-month DMFS 86.0 % (95 %CI 72.2-100 %). 12-month RFS and 
DMFS for patients with an MPR were both 91.7 % (95 %CI: 77.3-100 %). Grade 
3 + AEs at least possibly neoadjuvant treatment-related occurred in 2 patients 
(5.9 %).
CONCLUSION: Among patients with high-risk resectable Stage III melanoma, 
neoadjuvant atezolizumab/tiragolumab was a promising regimen with a favorable 
safety profile and warrants further study. A strategy to personalize neoadjuvant 
regimen selection is needed.

As people age, the progressive loss of cartilage integrity occurs, accompanied 
by a decline in the capacity to repair. This results in decreased resilience and 
increased susceptibility of cartilage to various physiological stressors, which 
raises the risk of developing osteoarthritis (OA). Therefore, restoring the 
regenerative capacity of chondrocytes and slowing down the aging process could 
be promising therapeutic strategies to mitigate or even reverse age-related 
joint diseases. Forkhead box class O (FoxO) proteins are a family of 
transcription factors that play a crucial role in various cellular processes 
linked to aging. Their significant functions in cell cycle regulation, 
apoptosis, and resistance to oxidative stress highlight their importance in 
maintaining cellular homeostasis and promoting longevity. In this review, we 
introduce the structures and functions of FoxO proteins in chondrocytes, 
focusing on their spatiotemporal regulation of epigenetics during chondrocyte 
differentiation stages in different layers. The critical roles of FoxO proteins 
in maintaining chondrocyte homeostasis are summarized, alongside a discussion of 
how FoxO dysfunction contributes to aging and OA. Furthermore, therapeutic 
strategies targeting FoxO proteins to mitigate aging-related cartilage 
degradation and decelerate OA progression are explored. Finally, potential 
directions for future research are proposed to deepen the current understanding 
of FoxO proteins.
THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: FoxO transcription factors, 
especially FoxO1 and FoxO3, are promising therapeutic targets for promoting 
longevity, stimulating cartilage regeneration, and treating aging-related 
diseases like OA.

Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) is one of the most 
downregulated genes in the brain capillary endothelial cells derived from 
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Endothelin-1 (ET-1) significantly 
contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. We hypothesized that loss of BACE2 
increases production of ET-1 from human brain microvascular endothelial cells 
(BMECs). Genetic inactivation of BACE2 in cultured human BMECs significantly 
upregulated expression and release of ET-1. Mechanistic studies indicated that 
γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2/transforming growth factor beta 2 
signaling pathway mediated the effect of BACE2 inhibition on ET-1 production.

of Clinical Anatomy (Lachman), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN and Department of 
Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL (Spencer-Gardner).

Iliopsoas impingement and tendinitis are a relatively uncommon but debilitating 
complication after total hip arthroplasty. Treatment for symptomatic iliopsoas 
pathology includes conservative management (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, 
ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections, and physical therapy), iliopsoas 
tenotomy or fractional lengthening, and revision total hip arthroplasty with 
acetabular implant revision. Recognizing the etiologies of impingement as well 
as techniques and published outcomes of available treatment modalities is 
helpful in patient counselling, management, and optimization of clinical 
outcomes in symptomatic patients.

OBJECTIVE: Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common complication associated 
with warfarin use. However, the optimal approach for anticoagulation 
reversal-whether with prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma 
(FFP), vitamin K (intravenous or oral), or no reversal-remains unclear as 
current literature and society guidelines do not provide definitive 
recommendations.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of emergency department patients with 
warfarin-associated GIB who presented to an academic health system was 
performed, comparing reversal with PCC, FFP, vitamin K only, or no reversal 
agent. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes 
included rebleeding events and 30-day thrombotic events. Standardized guidelines 
for reporting were followed (STROBE).
RESULTS: Of 815 patients, within 12 h of presentation, 10.7 % received reversal 
with PCC (with or without vitamin K), 12.9 % with FFP (with or without vitamin 
K), and 34.9 % with vitamin K alone; 41.5 % of patients received no reversal 
agent. Compared to all other groups, patients receiving PCC had significantly 
higher 30-day mortality (18.4 % [PCC] vs 5.7 % [FFP] vs 4.6 % [vitamin K] vs 
5.6 % [no reversal], p < 0.001), which remained significant after adjusting for 
hemodynamic instability and ICU admission. There were no significant differences 
in rates of thrombotic event within 30 days (3.4 % vs 3.8 % vs 1.4 % vs 1.2 %, 
p = 0.20).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received PCC had a threefold increase in mortality 
compared to FFP, vitamin K alone, or no reversal, even after adjusting for 
severity of the bleeding. Further research is necessary to understand factors 
leading to this observed mortality difference among patients with warfarin 
related GIB.

Outcomes in classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) have steadily improved; however, 
additional therapies are needed for patients who relapse or do not respond to 
novel agents. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of camidanlumab tesirine 
(Cami), an anti-CD25 antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with 
relapsed/refractory cHL following brentuximab vedotin/programmed cell death 
protein 1 inhibitor therapies from the phase 2 ADCT-301-201 study. Eligible 
patients were adults with cHL who had received ≥3 prior lines of systemic 
therapy (or ≥2 if ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplant). Patients 
received 45 μg/kg Cami (intravenously, once every 3 weeks [Q3W]) in cycles 1 to 
2, followed by 30 μg/kg IV Q3W for ≤1 year. The primary endpoint was overall 
response rate (ORR) per 2014 Lugano Classification. Secondary endpoints included 
complete response rate (CRR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall 
survival (OS). In total, 117 patients were enrolled with a median age of 37.0 
(range, 19, 87) years. The ORR was 70.1% (95% CI, 60.9, 78.2) with a CRR of 
33.3% (24.9, 42.6). The median PFS was 9.13 (95% CI, 5.3, 15.0) months; median 
OS was not reached. Thirty-three (28.2%) patients discontinued treatment because 
of treatment-emergent adverse events; the most common reasons were skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders (10 [8.5%] patients), infections and infestations 
(5 [4.3%]), and nervous systems disorders (5 [4.3%]). Guillain-Barré- or 
polyradiculopathy-type events occurred in 8 (6.8%) patients. Cami was 
efficacious in this heavily pretreated population; however, the efficacy was 
overshadowed by substantial issues with the safety profile. NCT04052997.

Standardizing terminology to annotate electrophysiological events can improve 
both computational research and clinical care. Enriching data with standard 
terms facilitates data exploration, from case studies to mega-analyses. The 
machine readability of such electrophysiological event annotations is essential 
for performing automated analyses. The Hierarchical Event Descriptor (HED) 
framework provides a standard for describing events in neuroscience experiments 
but does not yet include terms for electrophysiological data features. The 
Standardized Computer-based Organized Reporting of EEG (SCORE) defines terms for 
EEG features but is not yet openly available in machine-readable format. This 
study therefore developed a HED library schema for SCORE: the HED-SCORE library 
schema. This library schema makes the SCORE terms machine-readable and 
searchable and extents the standard HED schema with a controlled hierarchical 
vocabulary to annotate electrophysiological events. We demonstrate that the 
HED-SCORE library schema can be used to annotate events in EEG data stored in 
the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). Clinicians and researchers worldwide 
can use the HED-SCORE library schema to annotate and compute on human 
electrophysiological data.

PURPOSE: The Enhanced Primary Care Diabetes (EPCD) model is nurse led and 
leverages interdisciplinary support to improve diabetes quality indicators. The 
model has been found to be effective overall; however, because narrowing health 
disparities is a key objective, we aimed to assess differential effectiveness of 
the model among various racial and ethnic groups.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared the time to meeting the D5, a 
publicly reported quality measure (composite indicator of glycemic and blood 
pressure control, aspirin use for secondary prevention of cardiovascular 
disease, statin use, and documented abstinence from tobacco use), after 
enrollment in the EPCD program by Black, Hispanic/Latine, and Asian patients 
compared with White patients with diabetes (age 18-75 years) receiving care at 
13 primary care practices by multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. 
Patients enrolled in the program from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020; the 
study period end date was August 1, 2022.
RESULTS: The EPCD program enrolled 1,749 patients (none of whom met the D5 at 
entry) and 1,061 (60.7%) met the D5 during the study period. Black patients were 
less likely to meet the D5 compared with White patients (adjusted hazard ratio 
0.68; 95% CI, 0.52-0.90; P = .007); there was no difference among Asian and 
Hispanic patients compared with White patients. Compared with White patients 
(median 1.1/year; interquartile range [IQR] 0.4, 2.7), Asian patients had fewer 
nurse touch points (median 0.8/year; IQR 0, 1.4) during the study period, 
whereas Black patients had more (median 2.2/year; IQR 0.6, 4.0) and Hispanic 
patients showed no significant difference.
CONCLUSIONS: Time to meeting the D5 was longer for Black patients compared with 
White patients in the EPCD model, despite greater engagement with the care team. 
Further research is needed to identify factors driving these disparities.

BACKGROUND: The optimal radiotherapy regimen following mastectomy and immediate 
breast reconstruction remains under active investigation. In particular, the 
safety of moderate hypofractionation (HF) compared to conventional fractionation 
(CF) for postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) has not been clearly established. 
Given the growing adoption of HF in breast cancer treatment, a thorough 
synthesis comparing complication outcomes is essential to guide clinical 
practice.
METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane 
CENTRAL up to January 10, 2025. Studies comparing HF (2.4-2.7 Gy/fraction) and 
CF (1.8-2.0 Gy/fraction) in patients undergoing immediate breast reconstruction 
with PMRT were included. Studies involving partial breast irradiation or 
accelerated fractionation were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2 
and ROBINS-I V2; certainty of evidence was evaluated using GRADE. A 
random-effects meta-analysis was performed, estimating pooled odds ratios (ORs) 
with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO 
(CRD42023471267).
RESULTS: Eleven studies (n = 3611), including three randomized controlled 
trials, were included. HF and CF demonstrated similar risks of major 
complications (OR: 0.83; 95 % CI: 0.51-1.35; p = 0.45; n = 5). No significant 
differences were observed for infection, wound dehiscence, or hematoma among 
photon-based studies. HF was associated with a lower risk of capsular 
contracture (OR: 0.38; 95 % CI: 0.15-0.99; p = 0.05; n = 5). Only one study 
evaluated quality of life, reporting no difference in physical well-being.
CONCLUSIONS: HF offers a safety profile comparable to CF following breast 
reconstruction and may be preferred due to its reduced treatment burden and a 
potentially lower risk of capsular contracture.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if, and how, clinicians elicit and address health and 
medicine beliefs in osteoporosis consultations, and to evaluate the impact of a 
conversation aid (CA) on clinician behaviour.
METHODS: Secondary analysis of 107 video-recorded consultations from two trials 
evaluating CAs, using a bespoke coding tool to record the presence or absence of 
clinician shared decision-making (SDM) behaviours. In addition to descriptive 
statistics, Fisher's exact test examined differences between consultations with 
and without CAs.
RESULTS: Clinicians framed osteoporosis as a bone density (92 %) and/or fracture 
risk problem (78 % overall (96 % usual care vs 62 % aided, p < 0.001)). 
Biopsychosocial consequences of fractures were rarely mentioned. Clinicians 
asked questions to elicit beliefs in 58 % of consultations, most commonly 
general views on medications (47 % usual care vs 26 % aided, p = 0.03). 
Clinicians rarely asked about beliefs related to osteoporosis (n = 3), perceived 
need for (n = 1), concerns about (n = 5), or practical issues (n = 6) with 
medication. Clinicians used persuasion techniques more commonly in aided 
consultations (88 % vs 64 %, p = <0.001). Patient understanding was infrequently 
checked (12 %).
CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians miss opportunities to support patients to get the best 
from osteoporosis medications by tailoring communications to address necessity, 
beliefs, concerns and practicalities.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: We need better methods for supporting clinicians in 
eliciting patient beliefs about osteoporosis and the medications recommended to 
treat it, including their need, safety, and practical issues.

BACKGROUND: Massage therapists (MTs) and licensed acupuncturists (LAcs) are 
increasingly embedded within interdisciplinary care teams in both inpatient and 
outpatient settings. While not traditionally viewed as diagnostic providers, 
their extended, hands-on interactions with patients enable them to observe 
subtle physical and behavioral changes that may support early clinical 
recognition of underlying health issues.
OBJECTIVE: To present a case series in which MTs and LAcs identified abnormal 
clinical findings during routine care, prompting timely referrals that led to 
new or expedited diagnoses.
METHODS: Seven patient cases were retrospectively reviewed in which observations 
made by MTs and LAcs-such as localized swelling, tissue changes, or unexplained 
symptoms-led to further medical evaluation and diagnosis. Each case illustrates 
the value of sustained patient contact, therapeutic rapport, and clear 
interdisciplinary communication, supported by structured documentation and 
referral protocols.
RESULTS: In all seven cases, the MTs and LAcs played a pivotal role in 
accelerating clinical evaluation. Their observations contributed to the 
identification of conditions ranging from cellulitis, pneumonia, and melanoma to 
complex diagnoses such as multiple myeloma and arterial occlusion. Effective 
collaboration with nursing and physician teams through electronic medicine 
record documentation, internal messaging, and direct paging enabled appropriate 
and timely escalation of care CONCLUSION: MTs and LAcs, while practicing within 
their professional scope, can enhance diagnostic awareness through careful 
observation and patient-centered communication. When supported by institutional 
infrastructure and interdisciplinary trust, these providers serve as valuable 
contributors to early detection and care coordination. This case series 
underscores the importance of formally integrating integrative health 
practitioners into diagnostic workflows to improve patient outcomes and safety.

There is limited data on the effect of antiobesity medications in individuals 
with Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS). Here, we present a case of an adult with BBS 
who experienced significant weight loss following treatment with a combination 
of topiramate and phentermine. A 31-year-old female with BBS, with homozygous 
pathogenic variant in the BBS2 gene, presented with obesity, dyslipidemia, and 
obstructive sleep apnea. At 29 years of age, her body mass index (BMI) was 
43.3 kg/m2 (reference range 18.5-24.9 kg/m2), and she was initiated on 50 mg 
topiramate daily for migraine prophylaxis. With lifestyle modifications, BMI 
dropped to 40.5 kg/m2. Subsequently, phentermine 30 mg daily was added. Eight 
months after adding phentermine, BMI significantly decreased to 31.5 kg/m² (27% 
decrease in BMI), with improvement in glycemic and lipid parameters. She 
developed paranoia due to a social stressor prompting a brief hold of 
phentermine and resumption at a lower dose. This case highlights the weight loss 
response with phentermine and topiramate combination therapy in a patient with 
BBS. Further research is needed to explore the efficacy and safety of 
conventional antiobesity medications in isolation, as sequential or combination 
therapy to setmelanotide, to most effectively impact weight and metabolic burden 
in patients with BBS.

The aim of this international meta-analysis was to quantify the predictive value 
of body mass index (BMI) for incident fracture and relationship of this risk 
with age, sex, follow-up time and bone mineral density (BMD). 1 667 922 men and 
women from 32 countries (63 cohorts), followed for a total of 16.0 million 
person-years were studied. 293 325 had femoral neck BMD measured (2.2 million 
person-years follow-up). An extended Poisson model in each cohort was used to 
investigate relationships between WHO-defined BMI categories 
(Underweight:<18.5 kg/m2; Normal:18.5-24.9 kg/m2; Overweight:25.0-29.9 kg/m2; 
Obese I:30.0-34.9 kg/m2; Obese II:≥35.0 kg/m2) and risk of incident 
osteoporotic, major osteoporotic and hip fracture (HF). Inverse-variance 
weighted β-coefficients were used to merge the cohort-specific results. For the 
subset with BMD available, in models adjusted for age and follow-up time, the 
hazard ratio (95%CI) for HF comparing underweight with normal weight was 2.35 
(2.10-2.60) in women and for men was 2.45 (1.90-3.17). HF risk was lower in 
overweight and obese categories compared to normal weight [obese II vs normal: 
women 0.66 (0.55-0.80); men 0.91 (0.66-1.26). Further adjustment for femoral 
neck BMD T-score attenuated the increased risk associated with underweight 
[underweight vs normal: women 1.69 (1.47-1.96); men 1.46 (1.00-2.13)]. In these 
models, the protective effects of overweight and obesity were attenuated, and in 
both sexes the direction of association reversed to higher fracture risk in 
Obese II category [Obese II vs Normal: women 1.24 (0.97-1.58); men 1.70 
(1.06-2.75)]. Results were similar for other fracture outcomes. Underweight is a 
risk factor for fracture in both men and women regardless of adjustment for BMD. 
However, whilst overweight/obesity appeared protective base models, they became 
risk factors after additional adjustment for femoral neck BMD, particularly in 
the Obese II category. This effect in the highest BMI categories was of greater 
magnitude in men than women. These results will inform the second iteration of 
FRAX.

BACKGROUND: Prior to 2025, Medicare Part D included a coverage gap during which 
beneficiaries were responsible for substantially higher portions of medication 
costs. The impact of this on oral anticoagulant (OAC) prescription fills and 
subsequent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is not known.
METHODS: Using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services claims data from 
2016-2018, we evaluated OAC prescription fills in patients with AF by assessing 
their proportion of days covered on OAC before, during, and after their coverage 
gap. Hazard of stroke was assessed for patients who entered the coverage gap 
before entering, while in, and after exiting, the gap.
RESULTS: Patients who entered the coverage gap had a 16% decrease in median 
proportion of days covered from pre-gap (0.92 [interquartile range 0.80, 0.97]) 
to in-gap (0.76 [0.41, 0.98]). Proportion of days covered continued to drop for 
patients who entered and then left the coverage gap, despite regaining coverage 
(pre-gap: 0.95 [0.85, 0.98]; in-gap: 0.88 [0.55, 0.97]; post-gap: 0.70 [0.00, 
1.00]). Patients who entered the gap were at significantly higher risk for 
stroke while in the gap (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.91-2.54) and during the combined 
in-gap and post-gap periods (HR 3.13, 95% CI 2.71-3.62).
CONCLUSIONS: OAC use decreased upon entering the coverage gap and was associated 
with an increased stroke risk, that persisted for the rest of the calendar year. 
Health policy decisions regarding Medicare can have unintended adverse public 
health consequences, highlighting the importance of assessing the impact of such 
policy changes.

INTRODUCTION: Lead-related venous obstruction is a significant complication of 
chronic indwelling transvenous leads, which poses unique challenges during 
cardiac device upgrades.
BACKGROUND: The anatomical sequelae of venous occlusion are variable and carry 
important procedural implications. Occlusions can develop in any part of the 
venous system, but they most often occur in the subclavian and innominate veins, 
while the superior vena cava is less frequently affected.
METHODS: In this review, we describe approaches to lead-related venous occlusion 
providing step-by-step procedural guidance.
RESULTS: Venoplasty, neovascular channel creation are two main techniques for 
addressing lead-related venous obstruction.
CONCLUSION: Venoplasty in the setting of an indwelling pacemaker or 
defibrillator leads can be performed safely and effectively. The difficulty of 
the procedure lies in crossing the obstruction. Familiarity with various tools 
is needed for a successful outcome.

CONTEXT: Diagnosing adrenal insufficiency (AI) often requires complex testing, 
which can be time-consuming and expensive. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 
(DHEAS) is a promising marker of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function; 
however, its diagnostic performance has not yet been evaluated in a large-scale 
study.
OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the performance of DHEAS and baseline cortisol in assessing 
AI.
DESIGN: Single-center retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Referral center.
PATIENTS: Adults who underwent cosyntropin stimulation testing (CST) between 
2005 and 2023 and had DHEAS measured within 3 months prior to CST.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under receiver operating characteristic curve 
(AUROC) for DHEAS and baseline cortisol. Prevalence of AI based on various DHEAS 
and baseline cortisol concentrations.
RESULTS: Among 1135 patients, 195 (17.2%) had AI. Both baseline cortisol and 
DHEAS independently had good diagnostic performance with AUROC 0.81 [95% 
confidence interval (CI) 0.77-0.84 and 0.81 (95% CI 0.78-0.85)], respectively. 
Time of CST performance had no significant effect on diagnostic accuracy of 
baseline cortisol while recent glucocorticoid use decreased diagnostic 
performance of DHEAS (AUROC 0.72 vs 0.83). Only 1.2% of patients with baseline 
cortisol ≥10 mcg/dL had AI based on CST. Among patients with baseline cortisol 
between 5 and 9.9 mcg/dL, only 1.3% had AI if DHEAS was ≥60 mcg/dL. Conversely, 
the majority (72.2%) of patients with both baseline cortisol <5 mcg/dL and DHEAS 
<25 mcg/dL were found to have AI.
CONCLUSION: DHEAS has good diagnostic performance in assessing AI. Measuring 
both baseline cortisol and DHEAS concentrations may eliminate the need for 
further dynamic testing in many patients.

The Prevention of Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Periprosthetic Joint Infection 
in Patients Undergoing Dental Procedures Evidence-Based Clinical Practice 
Guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies examining the 
influence of dental care and procedures on outcomes after total joint 
arthroplasty (TJA) as well as strategies to mitigate potential risks associated 
with dental care and procedures in patients with a TJA. The scope of this 
guideline includes the role of dental screening, antibiotic prophylaxis, use of 
antimicrobial mouth rinses, and timing of dental procedures before and after 
TJA. The population was limited to patients with total hip arthroplasty (THA) or 
total knee arthroplasty because of a paucity of data on patients with other 
orthopaedic implants. Based on the best current available evidence, this 
guideline contains five options to assist all qualified clinicians, including 
orthopaedic surgeons and dental providers, considering the prevention of total 
hip arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty periprosthetic joint infections in 
patients undergoing dental procedures. It is also intended to serve as an 
information resource for professional healthcare practitioners and developers of 
practice guidelines and recommendations. In addition to providing pragmatic 
practice recommendations, this guideline also highlights gaps in literature and 
informs areas for future research and quality measure development.

BACKGROUND: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is a leading cause of morbidity and 
mortality. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is the standard of care for large vessel 
occlusions (LVO), but anatomical factors like intracranial vessel tortuosity can 
influence procedural success. This systematic review evaluates the impact of 
intracranial vessel tortuosity on outcomes of MT in AIS patients, focusing on 
recanalization success, hemorrhagic complications, and functional recovery.
DESIGN/METHODS: We conducted a systematic review following PRISMA guidelines 
across PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science until August 2024. Studies 
were included if they demonstrate the effect of intracranial vessel tortuosity 
on MT outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 321 identified studies, 8 met the inclusion criteria, comprising 
1942 patients. All studies focused exclusively on the anterior circulation. 
Studies evaluating the impact of intracranial vessel tortuosity on 
recanalization success have shown that higher tortuosity compared to no/low 
tortuosity is associated with an increased number of thrombectomy passes (mean: 
2.1 vs. 1.6) and lower overall success rates, with an average final Thrombolysis 
in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score > 2b achieved in (63 % vs 76 %) of cases. 
First-pass effect (FPE) success was lower in tortuous vessels (average 34 % vs 
59 %), with odds ratios for unsuccessful FPE ranging from 0.20 to 0.95. 
Tortuosity and functional recovery were inconsistently linked to hemorrhagic 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial vessel tortuosity reduces recanalization success and 
increases procedural challenges. Its impact on complications and long-term 
outcomes remains unclear, highlighting the need for further research.

INTRODUCTION: Treatment of Celiac Disease (CeD) requires a strict gluten-free 
diet (GFD). Adherence is difficult to assess and influenced by many factors. 
Identification of potential gluten exposures is essential, but no validated 
screening measures exist in pediatrics. The aim of this study was to develop and 
validate a measure screening for gluten exposure risk in pediatric patients with 
CeD.
METHODS: The Gluten Exposure Risk Assessment (GERA) was developed in three 
phases. First, items were generated and refined via a modified Delphi process. 
Next, psychometrics, factor structure, and validity was examined in a sample of 
caregivers of pediatric patients <18 years old with CeD at 12 pediatric celiac 
centers. Lastly, the final measure was tested on an independent sample 
population using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and test-retest data.
RESULTS: A total of 134 items were generated representing up to 6 domains, with 
36 items selected for initial testing. Based on psychometrics and CFA data from 
484 caregivers, the final measure included a total of a single screening 
question and 9 validated items representing two domains (Home, Outside). Repeat 
testing on a separate sample (N=369) confirmed factor structure and validity of 
the final measure (CFI = 0.96, TLI = 0.95, RMSEA = 0.06).
DISCUSSION: The Gluten Exposure Risk Assessment is a valid screening measure, 
completed by caregivers, for assessment of gluten exposure in children and 
adolescents with CeD following a gluten-free diet. GERA is a useful tool for 
evaluating the potential of risk for gluten exposure and potential need for 
intervention.

BACKGROUND: Hemorrhoidal disease and immunosuppression are prevalent. Management 
of hemorrhoidal disease in this patient population is challenging. Most 
societies recommend conservative management due to the presumed risks of morbid 
complications, including sepsis and impaired healing. Data on the risks of 
office-based and operative procedures in immunocompromised patients is scant.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate postoperative outcomes after both office-based procedures 
and operative intervention for hemorrhoidal disease in immunocompromised 
patients.
DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTINGS: Single-center, tertiary referral center.
PATIENTS: Adult patients with hemorrhoidal disease and primarily 
medication-induced immunosuppression undergoing an office-based procedure or 
operative intervention for hemorrhoidal disease while on immunosuppression at 
Mayo Clinic in Rochester between 2010 and 2023.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was development of infectious 
complications or wound complications.
RESULTS: Fifty-five immunocompromised patients, with a median age of 60, 
underwent a total of 68 hemorrhoidal procedures during the study time frame. All 
patients had immunosuppression induced by medication, except for one patient 
with bone marrow failure syndrome. The most common reason for immunosuppression 
was rheumatoid arthritis, followed by prior kidney transplant. The most common 
medications were chronic corticosteroids and methotrexate in over a third of 
patients each. Of 68 total interventions, hemorrhoidectomy (32%) and excision of 
a thrombosed hemorrhoid (26%) were the two most common operations performed. 
Sixteen adverse events were reported in 14 (25%) patients. Three cases of 
postoperative cellulitis were documented after thrombosed external hemorrhoid 
excision, hemorrhoidopexy, and Whitehead hemorrhoidectomy. No postoperative 
intravenous antibiotics were administered. No cases of pelvic sepsis were 
documented.
LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature of the study and the heterogeneity of the 
study population.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that office-based and surgical procedures are 
safe and feasible in patients with immunosuppression. See Video Abstract.

BACKGROUND: Shoulder arthroplasty is effective for reducing pain and improving 
shoulder function in older patients, but there is limited information on 
outcomes in patients aged 45 years and younger. Younger patients may be more 
active and require prolonged use of their operative shoulder, potentially 
increasing the risk of arthroplasty failure or revision. This study aimed to 
evaluate complication rates of anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA), 
hemiarthroplasty (HA), and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) in younger 
patients. We hypothesized that the complication rates would be comparable with 
those of older patients in existing literature.
METHODS: This multicenter, retrospective study included patients aged 45 years 
and younger undergoing primary TSA, HA, or rTSA with a minimum 2-year follow-up. 
Exclusion criteria were patients older than 45 years or those with revision 
surgeries. Primary outcomes were complications, reoperations, and radiographic 
analysis of component loosening or failure. Secondary outcomes included American 
Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores, visual analog scale pain scores, and range 
of motion (ROM). Statistical analysis was used to assess differences in 
outcomes.
RESULTS: Seventy patients, with an average follow-up of 85 months, underwent 35 
TSA, 30 HA, and 5 rTSA procedures. The most common operative diagnosis was 
osteoarthritis (44%). The overall complication rate was 19% and the reoperation 
rate was 13%, with no significant differences between arthroplasty types. 
Radiolucent lines were present in 14.3% (10 cases) of the humeral components and 
10.0% (7 cases) of the glenoid components. Glenoid radiolucencies were present 
only in the TSA group, with one (3%) patient undergoing revision for loosening. 
Clinical outcomes showed significant improvements in American Shoulder and Elbow 
Surgeons scores, visual analog scale pain, and ROM, with no differences between 
arthroplasty types.
CONCLUSION: Younger patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty have an acceptable 
complication profile, but a relatively high risk of reoperation. Glenoid 
component loosening occurred only in the TSA, with a 3% revision rate. All 
arthroplasty types showed significant improvements in ROM, pain levels, and 
function, indicating that patients benefit from the procedure. Nevertheless, the 
relatively high complication and reoperation rates for all three types of 
arthroplasty should be taken into account when considering shoulder replacement 
in those patients.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major contributor to the global 
disease burden. However, disparities in international trends of PE-related 
mortality have not been comprehensively examined across geographic, economic, 
and healthcare system parameters. We employed multifaceted stratification to 
analyse long-term trends in PE-related mortality.
METHODS: This epidemiological analysis used registration data from the World 
Health Organization Mortality Database. PE-related mortality was defined with 
the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Tenth Revision codes for acute PE (I26) and any forms of venous 
thromboembolism (I80, I822, I828, I829, O882, O222, O223, O229, O870, O871, and 
O879). Countries were deemed eligible for inclusion in the analysis if they 
provided mortality data for 5-year age intervals up to ≥85 years, from 2001 to 
2023 (last update, February 2025). Countries with incomplete age- and 
sex-stratified demographic data were excluded. We used locally weighted 
regression (LOESS) to show global trends in crude and age-standardised mortality 
rates. Subgroup analyses by geographic region and income level were also 
performed. Additionally, joinpoint regression analysis was performed to estimate 
the average annual per cent change (AAPC) in the age-standardised mortality 
trends for each country during 2010-2023.
FINDINGS: Data from 73 countries, encompassing 1,550,883 participants [57.8% 
(896,393) of whom were female], were eligible for the LOESS analysis, while 
those from 75 countries, including 915,518 participants (56.9% (520,587) of whom 
were female) were valid for the joinpoint analysis. The LOESS estimates of 
global age-standardised PE-related mortality rate (per 100,000) decreased from 
3.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.20-3.79) in 2001 to 2.42 (95% CI, 
2.04-2.80) in 2023. The age-standardised mortality rates considerably reduced in 
European regions, such as Western Europe, from 5.24 (95% CI, 4.75-5.74) to 2.25 
(95% CI, 1.62-2.87) in 2023; however, in Africa, they remained high from 4.23 
(95% CI, 3.82-4.64) in 2001 to 3.90 (95% CI, 2.81-5.00) in 2023. High-income 
countries showed a continuous downward trend, from 3.68 (95% CI, 3.28-4.08) in 
2001 to 2.20 (95% CI, 1.68-2.71) in 2023, whereas lower-to middle-income 
countries showed a rising trend, from 0.92 (95% CI, 0.04-1.81) in 2001 to 4.82 
(95% CI, 3.12-6.52) in 2023. Higher increases in the age-standardised mortality 
rates were predominantly observed in lower-middle-income countries.
INTERPRETATION: Globally, the PE-related mortality rate has declined over the 
last two decades, except in countries with certain geographical and economic 
conditions. Despite the potential limitation of misclassification and 
underreporting, our efforts corroborated that greater efforts are needed to 
reduce PE-related mortality, especially for populations in susceptible regions 
and lower-middle-income countries. A multi-layered approach will increase 
awareness of the disease and facilitate the development of healthcare policies 
that enhance its clinical management.

BACKGROUND: Deep learning-based models enable the prediction of molecular 
biomarkers from histopathology slides of colorectal cancer stained with 
haematoxylin and eosin; however, few studies have assessed prediction targets 
beyond microsatellite instability (MSI), BRAF, and KRAS systematically. We aimed 
to develop and validate a multi-target model based on deep learning for the 
simultaneous prediction of numerous genetic alterations and their associated 
phenotypes in colorectal cancer.
METHODS: In this multicentre cohort study, tissue samples from patients with 
colorectal cancer were obtained by surgical resection and stained with 
haematoxylin and eosin. These samples were then digitised into whole-slide 
images and used to train and test a transformer-based deep learning algorithm 
for biomarker detection to simultaneously predict multiple genetic alterations 
and provide heatmap explanations. The primary dataset comprised 1376 patients 
from five cohorts who underwent comprehensive panel sequencing, with an 
additional 536 patients from two public datasets for validation. We compared the 
model's performance against conventional single-target models and examined the 
co-occurrence of alterations and shared morphology.
FINDINGS: The multi-target model was able to predict numerous biomarkers from 
pathology slides, matching and partly exceeding single-target transformers. In 
the primary external validation cohorts, mean area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve (AUROC) for the multi-target transformer was 0·78 (SD 0·01) 
for BRAF, 0·88 (0·01) for hypermutation, 0·93 (0·01) for MSI, and 0·86 (0·01) 
for RNF43; predictive performance was consistent across metrics and supported by 
co-occurrence analyses. However, biomarkers with high AUROCs largely correlated 
with MSI, with model predictions depending considerably on morphology associated 
with MSI at pathological examination.
INTERPRETATION: By use of morphology associated with MSI and more subtle 
biomarker-specific patterns within a shared phenotype, the multi-target 
transformers efficiently predicted biomarker status for diverse genetic 
alterations in colorectal cancer from slides stained with haematoxylin and 
eosin. These results highlight the importance of considering mutational 
co-occurrence and common morphology in biomarker research based on deep 
learning. Our validated and scalable model could support extension to other

The MYC family of transcription factors-comprising c-MYC, N-MYC, and L-MYC-plays 
a pivotal role in oncogenesis, driving cancer progression and resistance to 
therapy. While MYC proteins have long been considered challenging drug targets 
due to their intricate structures, recent advances have led to the development 
of promising inhibitors. This review explores the role of MYC overexpression in 
promoting radiation therapy resistance in aggressive neuroendocrine malignancies 
through multiple mechanisms, including increased tumor cell invasion, enhanced 
DNA damage repair and oxidative stress management, prosurvival autophagy, 
survival of circulating tumor cells, angiogenesis, awakening from dormancy, and 
modulation of chronic inflammation and host immunity. Paradoxically, MYC 
overexpression can also enhance radiosensitivity in certain cancer cells by 
driving proapoptotic pathways, such as reactive oxygen species-induced DNA 
damage that overwhelms cellular repair mechanisms, ultimately leading to cell 
death. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive summary of direct MYC 
inhibitors, detailing their current stage of preclinical and clinical 
development as novel anticancer therapeutics. This review highlights the role of 
MYC in cancer metastasis and radiation therapy resistance while examining the 
potential of MYC inhibitors as radiosensitizers in adult and pediatric 
neuroendocrine malignancies, including small cell lung cancer, large cell 
neuroendocrine lung cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine-differentiated 
prostate cancer, neuroblastoma, central nervous system embryonal tumors, and 
medulloblastoma.

BACKGROUND: The redislocation rate for revision total hip arthroplasty (R-THA) 
done for instability ranges from 21 to 39%. Large femoral heads, constrained 
liners (CL), or dual-mobility (DM) implants are used to address this issue. This 
study assessed cumulative redislocation and re-revision rates after R-THA was 
performed for instability and identified associated risk factors for failure.
METHODS: There were 472 hips (468 patients) undergoing first-time R-THA due to 
instability between 2006 and 2021. The DM bearings were used after 2010. The 
mean age of patients at the time of surgery was 67 years (range, 15 to 94), with 
a mean body mass index of 29.4 (range, 17.3 to 55.9); 61.2% were women, and 9.5% 
were current smokers. Data on patient characteristics, surgical factors, and 
surgical management strategies were collected. Time to redislocation, 
rerevision, or the latest follow-up served as survival endpoints. Cumulative 
risks and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated.
RESULTS: At five years, cumulative redislocation and all-cause rerevision risks 
were 20 and 22%, respectively, increasing to 24 and 38% at 10 years. Risk 
factors for redislocation and rerevision included nonosteoarthritis index THA 
(HR 2.45, P < 0.0001; HR 2.36, P < 0.0001), smoking history (HR 2.93, P = 
0.0001; HR 2.37, P = 0.0013), and cup retention (HR 1.84, P = 0.0156; HR 1.99, P 
= 0.0035), respectively. The best-performing strategy to prevent redislocation 
was cup revision with a DM implant (5-year redislocation incidence of 7%). 
Comparatively, the risk of redislocation was higher for cup revision CL (HR 
1.64, P = 0.57), cup retention CL(HR 2.96, P = 0.049), cup revision with ≥ 36 mm 
head (HR 3.12, P = 0.049), cup retention DM (HR 3.81, P = 0.033), cup revision 
with < 36 mm head (HR 4.1, P = 0.066), cup retention with ≥ 36 mm head (HR 4.27, 
P = 0.0078), and cup retention with < 36 mm head (HR 6.93, P = 0.0008).
CONCLUSIONS: A R-THA for instability presents ongoing challenges with high 
reoperation and rerevision rates. Patient optimization (e.g., smoking 
cessation), acetabular component revision when appropriate, and implantation of 
DM or CL should be considered.

BACKGROUND: The Pediatric Oncology Group P9262 Phase 2 study of single-agent 
paclitaxel demonstrated one complete response (CR), one partial response (PR), 
and four with stable disease (SD) among 15 patients with recurrent Wilms tumor 
(WT). Based on this activity, paclitaxel-containing regimens have been used as 
salvage therapy for treatment-refractory WT. We conducted a multi-institutional 
retrospective study to further characterize the clinical activity of 
paclitaxel-containing regimens in recurrent WT.
METHODS: Twelve institutions submitted anonymized data from patients with 
relapsed WT treated with paclitaxel. Response after one or two cycles of a 
paclitaxel-containing regimen was reported according to Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with a median age at diagnosis of 5.5 years 
(range: 3 months to 31.9 years) were reported. Twenty had non-anaplastic WT; 
eight had diffuse anaplasia (DA). Stage at diagnosis was I (n = 1), II (n = 1), 
III (n = 11), IV (n = 14), and V (n = 1). Patients received a mean of 8.5 
anticancer drugs (range: 6-12) before paclitaxel, including eight who received 
high-dose therapy/stem cell transplant. Paclitaxel (n = 13) or nab-paclitaxel (n 
= 15) were predominantly administered in combination with other agents, most 
commonly doxorubicin and/or gemcitabine. Eleven of 26 patients with measurable 
disease had a partial response (7 = non-anaplastic; 4 = DA), four had stable 
disease, and 11 had progressive disease. Two patients without measurable disease 
maintained a complete response for 12 and 16 months. The mean duration without 
progression was 7.6 months (range: 1-35 months).
CONCLUSIONS: Paclitaxel-containing regimens appear to be active against heavily 
pretreated WT with either non-anaplastic or DA histology. Prospective studies 
are warranted to formally evaluate the efficacy of paclitaxel-based therapies.

Family caregivers of patients with rehabilitation and chronic care needs are 
often instrumental in helping to minimize patient risks for safety and other 
adverse health events and to avoid unnecessary health care utilization. In the 
United States, outside of the inpatient rehabilitation unit, they often 
undertake complex care tasks with minimal training. Heretofore, caregiver 
training in outpatient, home health, or other care settings has not been a 
priority, because of lack of reimbursement by insurance payers. In this special 
communication, we describe novel new codes and reimbursement policies approved 
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for caregiver training, 
discuss their advantages over previous policies, and present potential practice 
improvements and research opportunities to assess the effect of these codes on 
patient and caregiver outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Total kidney and liver volumes are key image-based biomarkers to 
predict the severity of kidney and liver phenotype in autosomal dominant 
polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, MRI-based advanced biomarkers like 
total cyst number (TCN) and cyst parenchyma surface area (CPSA) have been shown 
to more accurately assess cyst burden and improve the prediction of disease 
progression. The main aim of this study is to extend the calculation of advanced 
biomarkers to other imaging modalities; thus, we propose a fully automated model 
to segment kidney and liver cysts in CT images.
METHODS: Abdominal CTs of ADPKD patients were gathered retrospectively between 
2001-2018. A 3D deep-learning method using the nnU-Net architecture was trained 
to learn cyst edges-cores and the non-cystic kidney/liver parenchyma. Separate 
segmentation models were trained for kidney cysts in contrast-enhanced CTs and 
liver cysts in non-contrast CTs using an active learning approach. Two 
experienced research fellows manually generated the reference standard 
segmentation, which were reviewed by an expert radiologist for accuracy.
RESULTS: Two-hundred CT scans from 148 patients (mean age, 51.2 ± 14.1 years; 
48% male) were utilized for model training (80%) and testing (20%). In the test 
set, both models showed good agreement with the reference standard 
segmentations, similar to the agreement between two independent human readers 
(model vs reader: TCNkidney/liver r=0.96/0.97 and CPSAkidney r=0.98), 
inter-reader: TCNkidney/liver r=0.96/0.98 and CPSAkidney r=0.99).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that automated models can segment kidney and 
liver cysts accurately in CT scans of patients with ADPKD.

BACKGROUND: Patients with functioning pituitary adenomas (FPA) require a 
multidisciplinary team-based approach to select best medical, surgical, and 
radiation treatments, including stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to provide evidence-based recommendations 
on the use of SRS for adult patients with FPA.
METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched from data base inception to June 8, 
2021. Full-text articles were then screened using published exclusion/inclusion 
criteria. Evidence tables were developing based on data extraction from the 
full-text reviews, and evidence-based recommendations were finalized.
RESULTS: Of the total 1842 abstracts pertinent to this topic, 343 full articles 
met eligibility. Of these, 21 met entry criteria and were included in the 
evidence tables. The provided Class III evidence supported 2 Level III 
recommendations: 1. SRS, hypofractionated SRS, fractionated (>5 fractions) 
radiotherapy, and conventional radiation therapy provide excellent radiographic 
control with variable hormonal reduction and endocrine remission rates. For SRS 
and fractionated radiotherapy hormonal reduction may continue for up to 10 years 
after treatment. 2. Clinicians may continue to administer endocrine suppressive 
medical treatment before SRS as this may not affect radiographic control.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review provides evidence-based recommendations to 
guide providers caring for adult patients with FPA when making decisions 
pertinent to radiosurgery. The CNS Guidelines Committee will continue to pursue 
timely updates to further improve the care of patients with this diagnosis.

OBJECTIVES: To describe national performance on complete vital sign assessment 
during emergency medical services (EMS) encounters resulting in non-transport, 
stratified by patient, agency, and incident characteristics.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the 2023 National EMS 
Information System (NEMSIS) Public Release Research Dataset. Adult (≥18 years) 
patients from 9-1-1 incidents resulting in non-transport were included, 
excluding cases with cardiac arrest prior to EMS arrival. A complete vital sign 
set was defined as heart rate, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, systolic blood 
pressure, and level of consciousness. Descriptive statistics and univariable 
logistic regression were used to evaluate performance across demographic, 
agency, and incident-level variables.
RESULTS: Among 5,983,628 eligible non-transport incidents, only 54.6% 
(n = 3,267,407) had a complete set of vital signs documented, while 9.8% 
(n = 586,968) had no documented vitals. Assessment and documentation of 
individual vital signs ranged from 70.9% (SpO₂) to 86.0% (heart rate). 
Agency-level performance varied widely, with Advanced Life Support units 
achieving 57.3% complete assessments compared to 44.7% for Basic Life Support 
and 26.8% for Emergency Medical Responder units. Vital sign assessment varied 
with scene time, significantly improving when scene time exceeded 15 min. Vital 
sign completeness was highest for dispatches related to chest pain and breathing 
problems and lowest for behavioral issues and motor vehicle collisions. Falls in 
patients aged 60 years and older represented a large subset of incomplete 
assessments, accounting for 15.1% of all non-transport incidents with incomplete 
vital signs and 18.2% of patients with no vital signs.
CONCLUSIONS: Nearly half of EMS non-transport incidents lack complete vital sign 
assessment, and 10% have no vitals recorded. Given the critical role of vital 
signs in evaluating a patient's clinical condition and patient safety, these 
findings highlight substantial variability in EMS performance and a need for 
targeted quality improvement-particularly in high-risk populations such as older 
adults following falls.

We critically examine the implications of Aggarwal et al.'s study on low- versus 
high-dose prednisolone induction in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). While 
acknowledging the study's contribution, this letter argues that the 
predominantly cirrhotic and often decompensated patient cohort limits the 
generalizability of its findings to the broader AIH population. We emphasize the 
potential influence of advanced liver disease on treatment response and side 
effect profiles, suggesting that similar efficacy between low- and high-dose 
prednisolone may not extend to all AIH patients. We contend that future research 
should prioritize more representative AIH cohorts across the spectrum of disease 
severity to establish universally applicable corticosteroid dosing strategies.

PURPOSE: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to e-cigarette use. To 
date, no studies have examined the association between ACEs and e-cigarette 
cessation. This study examined the relationship between ACEs and vaping 
cessation outcomes among adolescent e-cigarette users.
METHODS: Participants were n = 1,248 adolescent (13-17 years) e-cigarette users 
recruited nationally to a randomized clinical trial of vaping cessation who 
completed the PEdiatric ACEs and Related Life Events Screener at baseline. The 
primary outcome was 30-day point prevalence abstinence from nicotine vaping at 7 
months (missingness = vaping). Analyses examined associations between vaping 
cessation and individual ACEs items, risk strata (low: 0 ACEs; intermediate: 1-3 
ACEs; high: ≥4 ACEs), and domains of adversity using inverse probability of 
retention weighted logistic regression adjusted for baseline confounders.
RESULTS: Most participants (90.1%) reported at least 1 ACE, with 55.8% 
classified as high risk (≥4 ACEs). High-risk participants showed 20% lower 
abstinence rates compared to combined low or intermediate-risk groups (risk 
ratio = 0.79, 95% confidence interval = 0.69-0.91, p < .001). Each additional 
abuse experience was associated with a 7% decrease in abstinence rates (risk 
ratio= 0.93, 95% confidence interval = 0.87-0.99, p = .028), while neglect and 
household dysfunction domains showed no significant associations with cessation 
outcomes.
DISCUSSION: This study provides the first evidence of an inverse relationship 
between ACEs and vaping cessation success among adolescents. The results suggest 
that trauma-informed approaches may be valuable additions to youth vaping 
cessation interventions.

INTRODUCTION: Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sézary syndrome (SS) are the most 
common subtypes of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. While MF generally follows an 
indolent course, a subset of patients will experience progressive and/or 
treatment-refractory disease. SS is an aggressive cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
associated with high morbidity and mortality secondary to immune compromise and 
opportunistic infection. Although allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant 
(allo-HCT) is currently the only available potentially curative treatment 
modality for MF/SS and is included in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
and the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy treatment 
guidelines, there is no published guidance regarding referral criteria, timing 
and allo-HCT approach to help guide clinicians caring for these patients.
METHODS: Delphi survey of 32 specialists in dermatology (n = 9), transplant 
hematology/oncology (n = 10), nontransplant hematology/oncology (n = 8), and 
radiation oncology (n = 5) from across the United States. Consensus required 
agreement of ≥75% of participants.
RESULTS: Sixteen consensus statements were generated on 4 topics: 1) criteria 
for referral for consideration for allo-HCT, 2) allo-HCT preparative regimens 
and procedures, 3) disease status at the time of allo-HCT, and 4) 
multidisciplinary management in the pre- and post-transplant settings.
CONCLUSION: These clinical practice guidelines provide a framework for 
decision-making regarding allo-HCT for MF/SS and highlight areas for future 
prospective investigation.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Accurate interpretation of electrodiagnostic (EDX) 
studies is essential for the diagnosis and management of neuromuscular 
disorders. Artificial intelligence (AI) based tools may improve consistency and 
quality of EDX reporting and reduce workload. The aim of this study is to 
evaluate the performance of an AI-assisted, multi-agent framework (INSPIRE) in 
comparison with standard physician interpretation in a randomized controlled 
trial (RCT).
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 200 patients (out of 363 assessed for 
eligibility) referred for EDX. Patients were randomly assigned to either a 
control group (physician-only interpretation) or an intervention group 
(physician-AI interpretation). Three board-certified physicians, rotated across 
both arms. In the intervention group, an AI-generated preliminary report was 
combined with the physician's independent findings (human-AI integration). The 
primary outcome was EDX report quality using score we developed named 
AI-Generated EMG Report Score (AIGERS; score range, 0-1, with higher scores 
indicating more accurate or complete reports). Secondary outcomes included a 
physician-reported AI integration rating score (PAIR) and a compliance survey 
evaluating ease of AI adoption.
RESULTS: Of the 200 enrolled patients, 100 were allocated to AI-assisted 
interpretation and 100 to physician-only reporting. While AI-generated 
preliminary reports offered moderate consistency on the AIGERS metric, the 
integrated (physician-AI) approach did not significantly outperform 
physician-only methods. Despite some anecdotal advantages such as efficiency in 
suggesting standardized terminology quantitatively, the AIGERS scores for 
physician-AI integration was nearly the same as those in the physician-only arm 
and did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05 for all comparisons). 
Physicians reported variable acceptance of AI suggestions, expressing concerns 
about the interpretability of AI outputs and workflow interruptions. 
Physician-AI collaboration scores showed moderate trust in the AI's suggestions 
(mean 3.7/5) but rated efficiency (2.0/5), ease of use (1.7/5), and workload 
reduction (1.7/5) as poor, indicating usability challenges and workflow 
interruptions.
DISCUSSION: In this single-center, randomized trial, AI-assisted EDX 
interpretation did not demonstrate a significant advantage over conventional 
physician-only interpretation. Nevertheless, the AI framework may help reduce 
workload and documentation burdens by handling simpler, routine EDX tests 
freeing physicians to focus on more complex cases that require greater 
expertise.

High-grade gliomas, like glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are the most common 
malignant brain tumors in adults and are treated with the chemotherapy drug 
temozolomide (TMZ). In humans, a retrospective analysis of patients' overall 
survival suggests that morning dosing may confer a benefit over evening dosing. 
Circadian variation in O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene 
expression and promoter methylation has been implicated in increased tumor cell 
sensitivity to TMZ in the morning. Although patient compliance with timed oral 
administration of TMZ was high in a prospective trial, it is not known whether 
differences in daily sleep patterns of patients impact the biological time of 
drug administration or overall survival. Using wrist actigraphy collected from 
10 high-grade glioma patients, we quantified the moment of oral TMZ delivery in 
terms of wall clock time and internal biological time during the months after 
surgical tumor resection. We found that variation of daily rhythms within and 
between individuals caused dosing times to vary more in their internal 
biological time than wall clock time so that, for example, some doses taken by 
patients assigned for the evening (2000 h) were closer to the patient's internal 
biological morning. We conclude that wrist actigraphy provides a reliable and 
non-invasive estimate of personal circadian time that could improve efficacy and 
precision of TMZ delivery. These findings may inform personalized circadian 
medicine and optimized times for TMZ delivery in the clinic.

BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) can be lifesaving, 
but ICD shocks are also associated with worse quality of life and emotional 
distress for patients and their families, particularly near the end of life. 
Shared decision-making regarding deactivation is critical, yet it can be 
challenging due to limited patient understanding of their devices. Existing ICD 
educational materials often lack cultural and linguistic inclusivity, 
contributing to disparities in end-of-life care for Black and Hispanic patients.
METHODS: Patients with active ICDs at a large, urban safety net hospital 
completed a pre-survey, then watched a 7- to 9-minute video on the functions and 
deactivation of ICDs. Afterward, patients were surveyed about their ICD 
knowledge, preferences regarding four hypothetical end-of-life scenarios, and 
personal experiences.
RESULTS: Of 50 participants, 58% were non-Hispanic Black, 24% non-Hispanic 
White, and 18% Hispanic White. ICD knowledge improved significantly from 47.4% 
to 80.8% (p<0.001). Knowledge improvement was similar for non-Hispanic Black and 
Hispanic White cohorts but lower for Hispanic White patients (p=0.0001). 
Preferences for ICD deactivation changed for 72% of participants with 
hypothetical scenarios involving "being a caregiving burden" (p=0.009) and 
"having no hope of recovery" (p=0.001) showing the greatest increases in ICD 
deactivation preference.
CONCLUSIONS: Educational decision aids specific to a patient population can 
reduce disparities in ICD knowledge and promote informed decision-making, 
particularly in underserved populations. Improving patients' understanding of 
their devices increased certainty and preference for ICD deactivation in 
end-of-life scenarios. Despite promising results, persistently lower knowledge 
in Hispanic White patients signals the need for tailored educational strategies.

Role of sentinel node mapping in endometrial cancer in 2025.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim is to summarize the role of sentinel lymph node 
biopsy (SLN) in surgical staging for endometrial cancer (EC).
RECENT FINDINGS: The value of SLN in EC staging continues to be demonstrated in 
all clinically uterine-confined disease, as SLN matches or improves the 
diagnostic accuracy of pelvic±para-aortic lymphadenectomy (PLD ± PALD) while 
reducing recovery time, surgical complications, and risk of lower extremity 
lymphedema. High diagnostic accuracy allows recommendation of appropriate 
adjuvant therapy, and recent studies have shown that even patients with 
high-risk histology may undergo SLN as opposed to PLD ± PALD provided this is 
combined with appropriate imaging. Debate about the necessity of any lymph node 
assessment in patients with certain low-risk features continues, with a 
preponderance of evidence pointing toward universal SLN in patients undergoing 
surgical staging for EC. In patients with negative SLN and intermediate risk 
uterine factors, molecular profiling is recommended to augment information 
gained through surgical assessment.
SUMMARY: EC surgical staging with SLN is considered standard practice in 
clinically uterine-confined disease. This approach allows precise treatment 
recommendations without PLD ± PALD related side effects. The integration of 
molecular profiling with EC surgical staging will accelerate the benefits of 
therapeutic advances in EC.

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and resulting neurological disability are severe 
complications for a subset of infants with severe hemophilia A (HA). While 
prophylactic factor replacement reduces bleeding risk, it is typically delayed 
until after age 1 due to risks associated with central venous access placement. 
Emicizumab, a subcutaneous activated factor VIII (FVIII) mimetic, has 
demonstrated safety and efficacy in preventing ICH in infants under 12 months in 
the HAVEN 7 trial. Despite its high cost the cost-effectiveness of emicizumab 
prophylaxis initiated during the first year of life for infants with severe HA 
is not known. We developed a Markov cohort model to compare emicizumab 
prophylaxis to standard care (no prophylaxis) in infants aged 0-1 year with 
severe HA without FVIII inhibitors. The analysis was conducted from a US 
societal perspective over a lifetime time horizon across all accepted 
willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. The primary outcome was the incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in USD per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). 
Emicizumab prophylaxis and standard care accrued 25.6 and 25.1 QALYs at costs of 
$13.12 and $13.07 million, respectively, resulting in an ICER of $99,900/QALY 
(95% credible interval 84,000-120,000). Scenario analysis examining prophylaxis 
with low-dose emicizumab resulted in an ICER of $19,600/QALY (95% CI 
12,000-29,000). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that standard-dose 
emicizumab is the cost-effective strategy in 100%, 66%, and 0% of 10,000 Monte 
Carlo iterations at WTP thresholds of $150,000, $104,000, and $50,000/QALY, 
respectively, and in 100% across all WTP thresholds for low-dose emicizumab.

INTRODUCTION: Sentinel lymph node (SNL) mapping plays a crucial role in staging 
patients with an apparent early-stage endometrial cancer. Older age may be 
associated with lower detection rates due to factors such as decreased lymphatic 
flow; but consensus is lacking. This study aims to evaluate the impact of age on 
the SNL detection rate in patients undergoing minimally invasive surgical 
staging for endometrial cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included apparent 
early-stage endometrial cancer patients undergoing minimally invasive surgical 
staging, including SLN mapping across four ESGO-accredited centers (2020-2023). 
Patients were categorized into two age groups: <65 years, defined as younger 
adults and ≥65 years, defined as older adults. Univariate and multivariate 
logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of bilateral 
mapping.
RESULTS: Overall, 642 patients were identified: 342 (53.3%) patients were 
classified as younger adults and 300 (46.7%) as older adults. The overall 
bilateral SLN detection rate was 89.3%, with no or unilateral detection in 10.7% 
of patients. Older adults had a significantly lower bilateral detection rate 
than younger adults (85.0% vs. 93.0%, p = 0.005). Multivariate analysis 
identified age ≥65 years as the only independent predictor of failed bilateral 
mapping (OR 2.2, 95 % CI 1.3-3.8, p = 0.003). Other clinical, surgical, and 
pathological factors were not associated with mapping failure.
CONCLUSION: Age ≥65 is independently associated with decreased bilateral SLN 
detection in early-stage endometrial cancer. Nevertheless, SLN biopsy remains a 
feasible and reliable staging method in older adults when performed using 
standardized techniques by experienced surgeons.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral aneurysm recurrence remains a critical endpoint in 
evaluating the success of endovascular treatment. While smoking is a recognized 
risk factor for aneurysm formation and rupture, its impact on post-treatment 
angiographic outcomes is unclear due to conflicting evidence.
PURPOSE: To systematically assess the association between smoking and 
angiographic outcomes-including occlusion, recurrence, and retreatment-following 
endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms.
DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of 
Science was conducted from inception to June 25, 2024. Bibliographies of 
included studies were also screened.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were eligible if they involved adult patients with 
intracranial aneurysms treated via endovascular approaches and reported outcomes 
stratified by smoking status. Case reports, abstracts, and studies not reporting 
smoking data were excluded.
DATA ANALYSIS: Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. 
Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using generalized linear mixed 
models to estimate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression analyses were also performed.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-five studies involving 5,828 patients were included. 
Smokers had a higher rate of complete aneurysm occlusion (RR 1.12, 95% CI 
1.06-1.19; P < .01), especially among those undergoing flow diversion (RR 1.14, 
95% CI 1.07-1.21; P < .01). No significant differences were found in 
recurrence/recanalization rates (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.91-1.60; P = .20) or 
retreatment rates (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58-1.13; P = .22) between smokers and 
non-smokers. Heterogeneity was moderate to high for some outcomes but reduced 
after sensitivity analyses.
LIMITATIONS: Heterogeneity in smoking definitions, variable follow-up durations, 
reliance on retrospective data, and limited granularity on smoking intensity 
(eg, pack-years) may affect interpretation. Results are not generalizable to 
surgical clipping or long-term outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is associated with increased complete occlusion rates 
following flow diversion, but does not significantly impact recurrence or 
retreatment rates. While smoking cessation remains essential for vascular 
health, its influence on endovascular treatment efficacy may be limited. 
Standardized reporting and further mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate 
smoking's role in aneurysm healing.

BACKGROUND: The calf muscle pump is an understudied contributor to venous return 
from the lower extremity. This study aimed to determine if calf pump function 
(CPF) is independently associated with the severity of chronic venous disease 
classified by CEAP (Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology).
METHODS: The Mayo Clinic Vascular Laboratory database was analyzed from January 
2015 through September 2023. Ambulatory adults who underwent venous air 
plethysmography were included. Venous plethysmography assessed the severity of 
venous incompetence, and CPF was measured as ejection fraction (EF) per leg. The 
clinical component (C0 through C6) of the CEAP score was evaluated for each 
extremity at the time of the study.
RESULTS: A total of 7760 limbs from 3733 patients were analyzed. The mean age 
was 62 years, with 62% women. Venous obstruction was detected in 3.2% of limbs. 
Venous incompetence severity was categorized as normal (44%), mild (26%), 
moderate (19%), and severe (10%). A significant trend of reduced CPF was 
observed with higher CEAP scores (p < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression, 
adjusted for age, sex, degree of venous incompetence, and obstruction showed 
reduced CPF was a significant predictor (odds ratio 1.84, CI: 1.5-2.2) of 
active/prior ulcer (C5 or C6). In contrast to more severely reduced CPF, mildly 
reduced CPF (EF 40-49%) was not associated with active/prior ulcers.
CONCLUSION: This large contemporary study demonstrates that decreased CPF is 
associated with worse chronic venous disease. Importantly, we demonstrate for 
the first time that CPF is independently associated with active/prior venous 
ulcers after accounting for other venous physiologic parameters and 
demographics.

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal connections of arteries and 
veins without intermediate capillary components. As such, AVMs can remain 
asymptomatic or have a variety of clinical presentations ranging from mild 
headaches to severe symptoms like seizures, hemorrhage, and subsequent coma. 
Papilledema and increased intracranial pressure without hydrocephalus or 
hemorrhage are rare forms of presentations of cerebral AVM. The mechanism of 
intracranial hypertension accompanying brain AVMs is not entirely understood, 
and the right treatment strategy is controversial. Here, we present the 
treatment and outcomes of four patients with unruptured AVMs who presented with 
intracranial hypertension accompanied by visual symptoms, papilledema, and 
without evidence of hydrocephalus. In cases of AVMs accompanied by intracranial 
hypertension, AVM treatment should be considered the main target of management.

PURPOSE: Drug shortages represent a challenge in oncology care, with potential 
repercussions including suboptimal treatment options, treatment delays, and 
medication errors. However, there is scant evidence on how drug shortages 
interrupt cancer care delivery (CCD) nationally and specifically across National 
Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) community 
oncology practices.
METHODS: Between December 2020 and July 2024, 96 NCORP community oncology 
practices were enrolled. NCORP practice study staff completed the Drug Shortage 
Baseline Survey and Pharmacy Baseline Survey. The primary outcome was proportion 
of practices seriously affected by drug shortages (ie, encountered CCD problems 
[change to less effective treatments, adoption of more toxic alternatives, 
treatment delays, or an increase in medication errors or near misses]) in the 
past 3 months. Secondary outcomes included CCD problems among practices (eg, 
ethical dilemmas) and strategies used by practices (eg, use of alternative 
drugs, stockpiling). Finally, we described differences between seriously 
affected and nonaffected practices.
RESULTS: Nearly 54% of NCORP practices were seriously affected by drug shortages 
in the past 3 months, with 23 drugs (including carboplatin [24.7%], leucovorin 
[22.6%], and cisplatin [19.4%]). Seriously affected practices were more likely 
to report lack of suitable alternatives (34.7% v 13.6%), substantial resources 
spent (70.8% v 50.0%), and change to alternative administration (73.5% v 52.3%) 
and were less likely to hire staff to address shortages (16.3% v 36.4%). 
Strategies to address shortages included using alternative drugs (91.5%), 
stockpiling (87.2%), and developing action plans (84.0%). Most (50.5%) practices 
reported experiencing an ethical dilemma related to a drug shortage.
CONCLUSION: Drug shortages influenced CCD among NCORP practices. This study 
underscores the need for robust strategies and policies to mitigate these 
effects and enhance the resilience of oncology practices.

Surgical outcomes and perioperative factors associated with pediatric 
cranioplasty remain incompletely understood. The authors queried the National 
Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) database to evaluate 
outcomes and intraoperative/postoperative blood transfusions in patients 
undergoing cranioplasty between 2019 and 2023. A total of 249 patients (mean age 
9.1 ± 5.4 y) were included. Most cranioplasties (70.7%) utilized alloplastic 
materials compared with autologous. Blood transfusion was required in 24.1% of 
cases, predominantly on the day of surgery (86.7%). Multivariable analysis 
identified age (OR: 0.86 per year, 95% CI: 0.80-0.93, P < 0.001) and 
cranioplasty size >5 cm (versus ≤5 cm) (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.01-4.50, P = 0.049) 
as predictors of transfusion. The 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 5.3% at 
a mean of 14.6 ± 7.9 days from surgery, most commonly for a surgical site 
infection (33.0%). The 30-day unplanned reoperation rate was 2.9%, at a mean of 
10.2 ± 5.6 days. Autologous cranioplasty was not associated with higher odds of 
readmission (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.25-2.13, P = 0.66) or reoperation (OR: 5.04, 
95% CI: 0.96-36.99, P = 0.07) compared with alloplastic cranioplasty. Rates of 
readmission and reoperation following pediatric cranioplasty are comparable to 
other complex craniofacial procedures. Younger age and larger cranioplasty size 
are associated with higher rates of blood transfusion. Our results show that 
autologous reconstruction is not associated with higher short-term complication 
rates compared with alloplastic reconstruction, although future studies are 
still needed to further the understanding of the optimal cranioplasty material.

BACKGROUND: The global prevalence of obesity is on the rise, and evaluating the 
interplay between obesity and outcomes in thyroid surgery is increasingly 
important. This meta-analysis aims to investigate the safety of thyroidectomy in 
patients with obesity.
METHODS: PubMed, Ovid Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of 
Science were searched from its inception to February 2025 by independent 
reviewers using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analysis guidelines. The review was registered prospectively on the 
PROSPERO database (CRD42025630687).
RESULTS: Ten studies, including 108,153 patients, met eligibility criteria, with 
23,754 (22%) classified as having obesity. Patients with obesity had greater 
risks of experiencing recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (odds ratio, 1.15; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.04-1.28, I2 = 7%), hematoma (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.02-1.36, I2 = 0%), and wound complications (odds ratio, 
1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.60, I2 = 0%) compared with patients 
without obesity. Conversely, patients with obesity had lower rates of 
hypoparathyroidism (odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.71-0.88, I2 = 
0%). However, no difference was observed between groups regarding operative time 
(mean difference, 3.5 minutes; 95% confidence interval, -1.6, 8.7, I2 = 95%) and 
length of hospital stay (mean difference, 0.3 days; 95% confidence interval, 
-0.2, 0.7, I2 = 100%).
CONCLUSION: Despite having a lower risk of developing hypoparathyroidism, 
patients with obesity demonstrated increased risk for hematoma, recurrent 
laryngeal nerve injury, and wound complications. Nonetheless, further research 
exploring more stratified body mass index ranges and strategies to mitigate 
thyroidectomy complications is needed to ascertain the safety of patients with 
obesity undergoing thyroidectomy.

INTRODUCTION: ADPKD-IFT140 is the third most common disease-causing variant in 
autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) after ADPKD-PKD1 and 
ADPKD-PKD2. This study aimed to characterize the clinical presentation, 
progression, and distinctive imaging phenotype of ADPKD-IFT140.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with disease-causing 
variants in IFT140, nontruncating PKD1 (PKD1NT), or PKD2. Patients were matched 
by sex (48.1% male), age (mean [SD]: 57.7 ± 13.3 years), and height-adjusted 
total kidney volume (TKV; htTKV) (median [Q1-Q3]: 572.9 [314.1-1137.9] ml/m). 
Two predictive models were developed in the development cohort (n = 81): a 
deep-learning model incorporating cyst-parenchymal surface area (CPSA) and 
cystic index, and a practical model using percentage of TKVellipsoid occupied by 
the 2 largest cysts, with cyst volumes estimated from cyst diameters using the 
formula V = 6/ (d13 + d23) . Models were validated in an internal specificity 
cohort (n = 569) and an external sensitivity cohort (n = 36).
RESULTS: Patients with ADPKD-IFT140 exhibited fewer (median cyst number: 42) but 
larger cysts (average cyst volume: 12.1 ml), with 88.9% having no liver cysts, 
compared with ADPKD-PKD1NT and ADPKD-PKD2. The estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) of decline was slower in ADPKD-IFT140 (-0.69 ml/min per 1.73 m2/yr) 
than in ADPKD-PKD1NT (-1.62, P = 0.006) and in ADPKD-PKD2 (-0.90, P = 0.737). 
The deep-learning model demonstrated an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 for 
distinguishing ADPKD-IFT140 patients in the development cohort, and 88.9% 
specificity in the internal cohort. A volume-to-TKV ratio ≥ 18.6% identified 
ADPKD-IFT140 with an AUC of 0.814 and demonstrated 72.2% sensitivity in the 
external cohort.
CONCLUSION: We provide a detailed characterization of the ADPKD-IFT140 phenotype 
that can be distinguished using a practical or deep-learning segmentation model 
applicable in diverse clinical settings.

BACKGROUND: Mitral transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) is approved for 
patients with severe functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) beyond optimal 
medical therapy (OMT).
AIMS: We aimed to assess TEER's efficacy beyond OMT in patients with severe FMR.
METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted, including 
randomized controlled trials from PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and EMBASE up to 
September 2024.
PRIMARY OUTCOME: heart failure hospitalization (HFH); secondary outcomes: 
cardiovascular (CV) mortality, all-cause mortality, and Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores. Time-to-event data from Kaplan-Meier 
curves were reconstructed for individual patient data.
RESULTS: Three studies (1423 patients) were included. TEER significantly reduced 
HFH (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.92, p < 0.01) and CV mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 
0.66-0.95, p = 0.01), and improved KCCQ scores (mean difference 14.32, 95% CI 
10.85-17.80, p < 0.01) compared to OMT. No significant difference was found for 
all-cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63-1.02, p = 0.07). Prognostic 
meta-analysis showed a 34% reduced risk of HFH (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.96, 
p = 0.03), but no effect on all-cause or CV mortality. Reconstructed 
Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed a 34% reduced risk of HFH (HR 0.65, p < 0.001), 
with effect attenuation after 15 months in landmark analysis (HR 0.64, 
p = 0.07). RMST analysis showed a 2.9-month longer HFH-free survival with TEER 
(p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: In patients with FMR, TEER significantly reduces HFH, improves 
functional status, and lowers CV mortality at 24 months but does not 
significantly affect all-cause mortality. The device group experienced a modest, 
but significant, 2.9-month longer HFH-free survival compared to the control 
group. However, the reduction in HFH showed attenuation beyond 15 months.

OBJECTIVES: We describe the types of emergency department (ED) visits managed by 
non-physician providers (NPPs), including physician assistants and nurse 
practitioners, and emergency medicine (EM) physicians, assessing shifts in care 
patterns over time.
METHODS: We used data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
collected from 2009 to 2021. We classified visits by provider type: physician 
only, physician with resident, physician with NPP, and NPP only. We described 
characteristics of visits by provider type, including patient demographics, 
triage urgency, imaging, length of stay, and disposition, and analyzed using 
Poisson regression. We described the change in type of provider seen over this 
study period and further analyzed by triage urgency and hospital location.
RESULTS: Of 1.684 billion estimated ED visits from 2009 to 2021, 1.171 billion 
were managed by physicians without residents or NPPs (physicians only), 
136.3 million by physicians with residents, 209.1 million by physicians with 
NPPs, and 167.4 million by NPPs only. Patients seen by physicians only were 
older, were triaged as having more urgent needs, had a longer ED length of stay, 
and were more likely to be admitted compared to those seen by NPPs only. 
Physician-only visits decreased from 77% to 62%, while NPP-only visits increased 
from 6% to 11%. The physician with the NPP group similarly grew from 9% to 17%. 
For visits assigned a triage urgency level of 2 ("emergent"), physician-only 
visits decreased by 20%, physician with NPP visits increased by 13%, and 
NPP-only visits increased by 3%. In metropolitan areas, physician-only visits 
dropped 14%, with a 5% increase in NPP-only visits. In non-metropolitan areas, 
physician-only visits decreased 17%, with a 9% increase in NPP-only visits.
CONCLUSIONS: The EM workforce has shifted, with NPPs seeing a higher percentage 
of patients, including both lower- and higher-acuity patients. This shift is 
particularly prominent in rural areas but is evident across all regions.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize patients presenting to emergency 
departments (EDs) with abdominal pain and to validate risk categories defined by 
the Guidelines for Reasonable and Appropriate Care in the Emergency Department 
(GRACE-2) for low-risk recurrent abdominal pain.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting with 
abdominal pain between November 2019 and November 2023 across 21 EDs in Arizona, 
the Midwest, and Florida. Patients were categorized per GRACE-2 into recurrent 
and non-recurrent pain as well as low- and high-risk groups. Primary outcomes 
included 72-h returns and mortality at 30 and 90 days.
RESULTS: The study included 162,494 visits (112,896 unique patients; median age 
46 years; 61.2% female). Among these, 4.3% had low-risk recurrent abdominal 
pain. Patients with recurrent and non-recurrent low-risk pain had similar ED 
length of stay and discharge rates to each other, compared to patients with 
high-risk pain who had longer length of stay and lower discharge rates. At 
30 days after the ED encounter, patients with low-risk recurrent abdominal pain 
had similar mortality to patients with low-risk non-recurrent pain (0.4% vs. 
0.3%; adjusted RR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.85-2.03), while they had significantly lower 
mortality than patients with high-risk recurrent abdominal pain (0.4% vs. 2.3; 
adjusted RR = 3.14, 95% CI: 2.02-4.89).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the heterogeneity in patients presenting to 
the ED with abdominal pain. Among these patients, those with low-risk recurrent 
pain demonstrated similar lengths of stay, discharges, and mortality rates to 
those with low-risk non-recurrent pain and less favorable lengths of stay, 
discharges, and mortality rates compared to those with any high-risk features. 
These findings suggest that low- and high-risk features may be more useful than 
recurrent or non-recurrent pain in identifying patients who could benefit from 
more robust ED evaluations.

BACKGROUND: Transthyretin (TTR) is a highly conserved protein with crucial and 
broadly protective physiologic roles across organ systems and diseases. Evidence 
shows that TTR contributes to neuroprotection, cognition, glucose regulation, 
pregnancy, muscle development, and bone mineralization. In several disease 
states, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, 
cerebrovascular disease, and osteoporosis, higher TTR levels may be protective. 
Numerous studies have shown that low levels of TTR are associated with increased 
mortality overall and in relation to cardiovascular disease and several 
malignancies.
PURPOSE: There is a growing portfolio of approved and investigational 
transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) treatments that differ in their mechanisms and 
effects on circulating TTR. When selecting an ATTR therapy, clinicians must 
decide whether to stabilize and preserve TTR and its functions or knockdown and 
drastically reduce TTR. This review summarizes the vital physiologic roles of 
TTR in health and disease. We consider the potential effects on normal biologic 
pathways that may occur while therapeutically suppressing TTR and discuss 
clinical decisions concerning ATTR therapies in the context of the summarized 
literature.
DISCUSSION: TTR is essential for a broad range of physiologic processes and may 
confer clinically protective effects in neurologic and other organ systems. 
While a link between low TTR and severe disease and mortality is well 
established, it remains unclear whether long-term TTR suppression via ATTR 
therapies increases risk of disease. Clinical decisions in ATTR, however, should 
reflect the current understanding of the roles of TTR and the patient's clinical 
history.
CONCLUSION: TTR serves vital physiologic roles across organ systems. Given its 
clinically protective properties, continued investigation into the potential 
long-term impact of TTR suppression via knockdown or gene editing therapies is 
prudent. ATTR treatment selection should reflect an awareness of the physiologic 
importance of TTR, as well as consideration of the potential long-term impact of 
chronic TTR suppression.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the incidence of sleep disorders (SD) 
in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) vs. non-RA comparators, evaluate 
risk factors for SD, and assess the association between incident SD and dementia 
in RA.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included residents aged ≥50 years 
within an 8-county region of Minnesota who first met the 1987 ACR criteria for 
RA in 1980-2014. Individuals with RA were matched 1:1 with non-RA individuals on 
age, sex, and calendar year of RA incidence. Data on SD, cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk factors, CVD and other comorbidities were collected from the medical 
records.
RESULTS: Nine hundred thirteen individuals with RA and 913 non-RA comparators 
were included (mean age: 65 years, 65 % female in both cohorts). During the 
median follow-up of 10.4 years in RA and 11.0 years in non-RA cohort, SD 
developed in 234 and 206 individuals, respectively. RA patients experienced an 
increased risk for any incident SD (HR 1.34; 95 % CI:1.11-1.61) and insomnia (HR 
1.34; 95 % CI:1.03-1.73). Obesity, dyslipidemia, presence of CVD, depression, 
anxiety, and more recent calendar year of RA incidence were associated with 
increased risk of any SD in RA. There were no significant association between SD 
overall and by subtype with dementia in RA.
CONCLUSION: Individuals with RA (vs non-RA) experienced a significantly 
increased risk for any SD, particularly insomnia. CVD and CVD risk factors, as 
well as depression and anxiety increased the risk for incident SD in RA. There 
was no significant association between SD and dementia in RA.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic surgery is associated with significant morbidity. 
Cardiopulmonary fitness can predict postoperative outcomes. Similarly, poor 
insulin sensitivity is associated with postoperative complications. Supervised 
exercise training can improve cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity. 
Immunonutrition may work synergistically with exercise. The study aimed to 
assess the impact of a 4-week multimodal prehabilitation programme on 
cardiopulmonary fitness and insulin sensitivity in patients awaiting pancreatic 
surgery, compared to a control group receiving standard postoperative care.
METHODS: In this prospective, non-randomised pilot study, we recruited patients 
with benign or malignant pathology, listed for pancreatic resection. Subjects 
underwent a baseline cardiopulmonary exercise test. We measured insulin 
sensitivity using the gold standard technique, the hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic 
clamp. The 4-week intervention comprised: resistance and high intensity interval 
training (ten sessions) plus daily omega-3 fatty supplements (2g) and extra 
virgin olive oil (30 ml). Cardiopulmonary exercise tests and clamps were 
repeated after four weeks. These were compared with contemporaneous 
non-randomised controls.
RESULTS: Of 21 recruited patients, 12 out of 12 (prehabilitation) and 6 out of 9 
(control) completed the study. Prehabilitation led to an improvement in oxygen 
uptake at anaerobic threshold (+2.0 (95 per cent CI 0.1 to 4.0) ml kg-1 min-1) 
and peak exercise (+3.0 (95 per cent CI 0.7 to 5.3) ml kg-1 min-1), compared to 
controls. Within the prehabilitation group, there were significant improvements 
in peak power (P = 0.001), oxygen uptake at anaerobic threshold (P = 0.017) and 
peak exercise (P = 0.002). Cardiopulmonary fitness parameters were unchanged 
amongst controls. Insulin sensitivity did not change in either group.
CONCLUSION: Prehabilitation resulted in a significant improvement in 
cardiopulmonary fitness, before pancreatic surgery. The potential benefits of 
improved cardiopulmonary fitness must be balanced against the oncological and 
metabolic consequences of delay.

OBJECTIVE: Artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise in surgery, but its role 
in plastic surgery education remains underexplored. This review evaluates the 
current landscape of AI in plastic surgery education.
DESIGN: A systematic search was conducted on August 11, 2024, across PubMed, 
CINAHL, IEEE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar using terms related to 
AI, plastic surgery, and education. Original research articles focusing on AI in 
plastic surgery education were included, excluding correspondence, reviews, book 
chapters, theses, corrections, and non-peer-reviewed or non-English articles. 
Two investigators independently screened studies and synthesized data. ROBINS-I 
was used to assess bias.
RESULTS: Fifteen studies were included, with 13 evaluating large language models 
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Bing, and Google Bard. ChatGPT-4 outperformed 
other models on In-Service Examinations (average score of 72.7%) and 
demonstrated potential as a teaching assistant in plastic surgery education. 
AI-generated personal statements were comparable to human-written ones. However, 
ChatGPT showed inaccuracies in generating surgical protocols. ChatGPT 
demonstrated its ability to provide qualitative predictions, forecasting survey 
results that indicated limited current use of AI in plastic surgery education 
but support for further AI research. a study combined ChatGPT with DALL-E 2, a 
generative model, to create acceptable educational images. Machine learning was 
used in 1 study for evaluating surgical skill and providing real-time feedback 
during liposuction. Nine studies had low risk of bias, while 6 had moderate 
risk.
CONCLUSIONS: AI demonstrates potential as an educational tool in plastic 
surgery. However, limitations of evidence, such as AI model uncertainties, 
introduce ambiguity. While AI cannot replicate the expertise of seasoned 
surgeons, it shows promise for foundational learning and skill assessment. 
Developing authenticity guidelines and enhancing AI capabilities are essential 
for its effective, ethical integration into plastic surgery education.

INTRODUCTION: Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs) are novel immunotherapy agents for 
the treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Currently, 3 BsAbs 
(teclistamab, talquetamab, and elranatamab) are approved for the treatment of 
RRMM. Administering BsAbs in different practice settings is crucial to improving 
treatment access and patient outcomes. This report provides actionable guidance 
to implement safe and effective administration of BsAbs for patients with RRMM 
in outpatient and community settings.
METHODS: Three clinician advisory workshops were held in the United States, 
Europe, and Latin America to discuss key factors to operationalize BsAb use in 
outpatient and community settings, focusing on the critical phases of practice 
setup, treatment initiation, and ongoing management.
RESULTS: BsAb administration in outpatient and community settings requires 
careful planning, a well-prepared multidisciplinary team (MDT) of healthcare 
professionals, and clear protocols, including MDT composition, 
roles/responsibilities, capacity planning, patient selection criteria, step-up 
dosing procedure, admission processes, patient/caregiver education requirements, 
and adverse event (AE) monitoring/management. Comprehensive MDT training on 
protocols and preparedness to manage AEs is essential. Patients initiating 
outpatient BsAb therapy should have a reliable caregiver, access to a hospital, 
controlled comorbidities, and no active infections. Ensuring patients and 
caregivers understand the benefits, risks, and expectations of BsAb therapy is 
vital for successful treatment and a positive patient experience.
CONCLUSION: Administering BsAbs in outpatient and community settings can be done 
safely and effectively with appropriate planning and protocols. Enabling safe 
and effective BsAb administration in these settings is essential to ensure more 
patients with RRMM have access to treatment and improved outcomes.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) has long been associated with 
iron deficiency. Current clinical guidelines recommend intravenous (IV) iron 
therapy for patients with serum ferritin levels ≤ 100 µg/L, but the 
effectiveness and safety of IV iron in patients with ferritin levels between 
100-300 µg/L have not been well established. The aim of this study is to assess 
the efficacy and safety of IV iron in RLS patients with serum ferritin levels 
both below and above the 100 µg/L threshold, hypothesizing no significant 
differences in therapeutic response between these groups.
METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal retrospective analysis of 58 RLS patients 
treated with 1000 mg of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), with baseline serum 
ferritin concentrations <300 µg/L. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 
A (serum ferritin <100 µg/L) and Group B (serum ferritin 100-300 µg/L). We 
compared changes in symptom severity (IRLS scale), substantia nigra iron 
deposits (SNEI), and systemic iron parameters.
RESULTS: Both groups showed similar improvements in IRLS scores and SNEI. Serum 
ferritin increased significantly in Group B post-treatment, while no major 
differences were observed in TSAT or serum transferrin levels between the two 
groups. Regarding risk of iron overload, only 2 patients (Group B) showed a TSAT 
>45%. No harm resulted to either patient, with no hepatic dysfunction observed.
CONCLUSIONS: IV iron therapy is effective in RLS patients without hepatic iron 
overload with serum ferritin levels ranging from 100-300 µg/L. These findings 
challenge current guidelines and suggest that IV iron could be considered for a 
broader range of RLS patients.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the longitudinal changes of glycocalyx, a 
proteoglycan/glycoprotein layer that lines and protects endothelial cells in 
normotensive pregnancies (NPs); to correlate glycocalyx parameters with kidney 
injury markers (podocin-positive to nephrin-positive [P/N] ratio); and to 
explore changes in P/N ratio in preeclampsia.
METHODS: Plasma and urine samples and glycocalyx measurements using side-stream 
darkfield imaging were collected at each trimester from pregnant women (n=31). 
Plasma glycocalyx components were measured by ELISA, and urinary P/N-positive 
extracellular vesicles by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: In NPs (n=26), glycocalyx degradation increased from the first to the 
second trimester (P=0.008) and returned to first-trimester values in the third 
trimester (P=0.008). Microvascular perfusion decreased from the first to the 
second trimester (P=0.006) and increased back to first-trimester values by the 
third trimester (P=0.039). Plasma syndecan 1 level showed a steady increase from 
the first to the second trimester (P<0.001) and further in the third trimester 
(P<0.001); hyaluronic acid increased from the first to the second trimester 
(P=0.016) without further changes. Glycocalyx degradation was associated with an 
increase in P/N ratio from the first to the second trimester of NPs and remained 
stable through the third trimester. P/N ratio strongly correlated with elevated 
syndecan 1 and hyaluronic acid levels in the third trimester. Comparison of P/N 
ratios between NP and preeclampsia (n=5) showed higher values in preeclampsia 
across all trimesters (P=0.028).
CONCLUSIONS: Glycocalyx changes during NPs are associated with elevated urinary 
podocyte markers. Increase in P/N ratio across NPs, and further in preeclampsia, 
suggests that podocyte injury in preeclampsia is extension of physiological 
changes in pregnancy, which may predate its clinical presentation.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: A diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, 
monosaccharides, and polyols (LFD) is the most efficacious dietary therapy for 
irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the mechanisms by which fermentable 
oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols drive IBS 
pathophysiology are unclear.
METHODS: Patients with Rome IV diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) underwent 
barrier function evaluation pre- and post-LFD along with assessment of mast cell 
number and activation profile. Finally, fecal supernatants (FS) were 
administered intracolonically to wild-type mice with and without pharmacologic 
inhibition, toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-/- mice, and mast cell-deficient mice 
with/without mast cell reconstitution.
RESULTS: Of 42 patients, 34 responded to the LFD and 8 did not. Patients with 
IBS-D had significant improvement in colonic barrier structure and function, 
mast cell number, and levels of mast cell mediators post-LFD. The magnitude of 
physiological changes did not correlate with the magnitude of clinical response. 
Humanization of germ-free mice with pre-LFD feces caused barrier dysfunction and 
post-LFD feces did not. Similarly, pre-LFD FS caused barrier dysfunction in 
wild-type mice, whereas post-LFD FS did not. Lipopolysaccharide removal and TLR4 
antagonism reversed pre-LFD IBS FS-induced barrier dysfunction. Barrier 
dysfunction was absent in tlr4-/- mice treated with pre-LFD FS. Similarly, 
pre-LFD IBS FS did not cause barrier dysfunction in wild-type mice treated with 
mast cell stabilizer or in mast cell-deficient mice. However, barrier 
dysfunction was inducible in mast cell-deficient mice upon reconstitution with 
wild-type mast cells, but not tlr4-/- mast cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IBS-D exhibited improvement in colonic barrier 
dysfunction, mast cell recruitment, and activation post LFD. Fermentable 
oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols-mediated barrier 
dysfunction in IBS-D is mediated by direct activation of the TLR4 receptor on 
colonic mast cells by fecal lipopolysaccharide.

INTRODUCTION: Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), but whether it drives AD-associated changes is unclear. We assessed 
transcriptomic alterations in the brains of Ndufs4-/- mice, a model of 
mitochondrial complex I (mtCI) deficiency, and evaluated the therapeutic effects 
of the neuroprotective mtCI inhibitor CP2.
METHODS: Cortico-hippocampal tissue from Ndufs4-/- and wild-type mice was 
subjected to transcriptomic analysis, followed by cross-species comparisons to 
human late-onset AD and familial AD mouse datasets.
RESULTS: Knockout of Ndufs4-mediated mtCI deficiency disrupted mitochondrial 
homeostasis, energy metabolism, and synaptic gene expression, recapitulating 
transcriptomic signatures of AD. CP2 treatment partially reversed these changes, 
with female Ndufs4-/- mice showing greater compensatory adaptations and 
treatment responses.
DISCUSSION: Loss of mtCI activity alone is sufficient to induce AD-like 
molecular changes in the brain, independent of amyloid beta or phosphorylated 
tau. CP2-mediated rescue highlights the potential of targeting mitochondria as a 
therapeutic strategy for AD. Sex-specific responses suggest important 
considerations for personalized therapeutics.
HIGHLIGHTS: Activity of mitochondrial complex I (mtCI) affects broad 
mitochondrial and neuronal transcriptional networks. A reduction of mtCI 
activity is sufficient to induce transcriptomic changes reminiscent of those 
observed in late-onset Alsheimer's disease (AD) patients and familial mouse 
models of AD. Pharmacological targeting of mtCI mediates neuroprotective 
signaling. Male and female mice have differential responses to the loss of mtCI 
activity and to the mitochondria-targeted therapeutics. Mitochondria play a key 
role in AD development and treatment.

BACKGROUND: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) usage among childhood 
cancer patients remains understudied. Factors associated with CAM use and 
motivations of caregivers for using CAM remain poorly understood.
METHODS: This cross-sectional mixed-methods study was conducted among caregivers 
of patients aged ≤18 years with confirmed cancer diagnoses. Caregivers were 
interviewed regarding CAM use, reasons for using/non-using CAM, and views on 
CAM. Logistic regression identified factors associated with CAM use, whereas 
qualitative interviews explored motivations and barriers. The impact of CAM 
usage on 2-year overall survival was explored.
RESULTS: Out of 450 respondents, CAM usage was reported by 35.78% (n = 161), 
with home remedies (28.44%, n = 128) and AYUSH (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Yoga, 
Homeopathy) therapies (13.56%, n = 61) being most common. CAM use was associated 
with symptom duration ≥30 days (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.71; 95% CI: 
1.09-2.67; p = 0·019) and hematological malignancies (aOR: 2.05; 95% CI: 
1.33-3.17; p = 0·001). Major motivations for CAM use included belief in 
effectiveness (44.72%, n = 72) and family recommendations (34.16%, n = 55). 
Qualitative interviews highlighted cost, accessibility issues, and diagnostic 
delays as key drivers of CAM adoption. The 2-year survival probabilities of CAM 
users and nonusers were comparable (0.88 [95% CI: 0.83-0.94] vs. 0.87 [95% CI: 
0.83-0.92], log-rank p = 0.75).
CONCLUSION: CAM is frequently used by pediatric cancer patients, driven by 
caregiver beliefs, family influence, and access barriers. Addressing caregiver 
practices and integrating CAM discussions into care may enhance supportive 
strategies without impacting survival outcomes.

Newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in unfit patients: 2026 treatment 
algorithms.

Management paradigms for newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (ND-AML) in 
patients considered unfit to receive intensive chemotherapy have evolved with 
improved understanding of disease biology. In this setting, management requires 
clear delineation of goals of therapy that should include preservation of 
quality-of-life (QoL). Combination of venetoclax (Ven) and a hypomethylating 
agent (HMA) is the current standard-of-care in most circumstances with flexible 
options in regard to drug dose and duration of treatment as well as the addition 
(triplet combinations) or alternative use of targeted therapies, such as 
inhibitors of FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, or menin for patients with NPM1MUT or KMT2A 
rearrangements (KMT2Ar). Response rates (CR/CRi:40-90%) and overall survival 
outcomes (3-year: 0-67%) following Ven-HMA therapy are highly variable and 
depend primarily on tumor genetics while achievement of complete response with 
(CR) or without count recovery (CRi) and consolidation with allogeneic stem cell 
transplant (ASCT) are essential in securing long-term survival. Favorable 
genomic predictors of response to Ven-HMA include NPM1MUT, IDH2MUT, and 
DDX41MUT, and unfavorable TP53MUT, FLT3-ITD, and K/NRASMUT. Favorable predictors 
of overall survival include IDH2MUT, and unfavorable TP53MUT, FLT3-ITD, 
K/NRASMUT, and KMT2Ar. Whether or not triplet regimens provide significant 
survival gain over Ven-HMA in genetically targetable subgroups remains to be 
determined. Particularly frail patients who are considered unfit for Ven-HMA 
might benefit from monotherapy targeting FLT3MUT, IDH1/2MUT, NPM1MUTor KMT2Ar. 
Future research projects should focus on incorporating patient-reported outcomes 
in clinical trials, optimization of Ven-HMA dosing and treatment duration 
especially in triplet combinations and broadening the use of ASCT and 
clarification of its timing.

This Policy Review provides recommendations for the use of PET imaging in 
patients with gliomas and represents a joint effort of the Response Assessment 
in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group for PET and the European Association for 
Neuro-Oncology. The initial guideline was published in 2016, and summarised the 
previously established clinical benefit of PET with radiolabelled glucose and 
amino acid tracers in patients with gliomas. Since then, numerous additional 
studies have been published on this topic, focusing on differential diagnosis, 
prediction of molecular information, and prognostication. Further studies 
evaluated PET for biopsy guidance and delineation of glioma extent for local 
therapy planning, including resection and radiotherapy. In patients undergoing 
treatment, PET was studied for the assessment of response to local and systemic 
treatments and PET-based standardised response criteria (PET RANO 1.0) were 
proposed. In this Policy Review, the updated recommendations are based on 
evidence generated from studies that validated PET findings by histomolecular 
findings or clinical course. This guideline further underscores the previously 
reported clinical value of PET imaging and the superiority of amino acid PET 
over glucose PET, providing a framework for the use of PET in the management of 
patients with gliomas. The guideline also underscores the scarcity of class 1 
evidence showing that incorporating PET imaging into clinical workflows improves 
patient outcomes, highlighting priority areas for future clinical studies 
designed to address this gap.

Oral Kaposi sarcoma is a slowly progressing, HHV-8 related angioproliferative 
disorder strongly associated with immunosuppression. Regression can occur with 
treatment. We present a 49-year-old HIV-seronegative Caucasian male individual 
with two rapidly enlarging OKS lesions that spontaneously regressed and 
completely resolved without treatment after a few months. The individual was 
under treatment with valacyclovir for herpes simplex infection and was receiving 
emtricitabine/tenofovir for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis. Only the mandibular 
lesion was biopsied, revealing classic endothelial spindle cell proliferation 
with formation of slit-like spaces and multiple newly formed vessels. Nuclear 
HHV-8 was immunohistochemically confirmed. Serologic tests prior to and after 
the development of OKS did not reveal HIV infection. Emtricitabine/tenofovir 
prophylactic treatment may have contributed to the remission and resolution.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a clinical diagnosis characterized by the 
presence of left ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction unexplained by 
abnormal loading conditions or coronary artery disease. However, a broad range 
of phenotypic manifestations, encompassing isolated scar, DCM with preserved 
ejection fraction, and overt DCM, should be regarded as a diagnostic 
classification representing a broad spectrum of underlying aetiologies, 
including both inherited and acquired heart muscle disorders. A multimodal 
non-invasive imaging approach is essential for accurate morpho-functional 
assessment of cardiac chambers and is key to establish the cardiac phenotype and 
to rule out an underlying ischaemic aetiology. Furthermore, advanced imaging 
techniques enable deep cardiovascular phenotyping and non-invasive tissue 
characterization. The aim of this review is to propose a systematic approach to 
the diagnosis of DCM, emphasizing the importance of genetics and clinical 
findings for a precise and practical clinical approach. Also, we strive to 
qualify the role of cardiac imaging in the diagnosis of DCM, particularly on the 
relevance of novel techniques and clinical utility of actionable parameters to 
improve current diagnostic schemes and risk stratification algorithms. We 
further elaborate on the role of cardiac imaging to deliver optimal guidance to 
aetiology-based therapeutic approaches, verification of treatment response and 
disease progression monitoring.

INTRODUCTION: Conventional weight-loss strategies often result in inadequate fat 
loss, poor sustainability, and unintended lean mass loss. Prolonged water-only 
fasting followed by dietary change may offer an effective alternative, but its 
impact on body composition remains underexplored.
METHODS: This secondary analysis utilized dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) 
to assess changes in fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM), and bone mineral 
content (BMC) in adults [median (IQR) age: 62 (15) years with overweight or 
obesity. Participants underwent a median (IQR) of 14 (6) days of water-only 
fasting, followed by 6 (3) days of food reintroduction with a whole-plant-food 
diet and a subsequent maintenance period of 45 (5) days. Study visits occurred 
at baseline and at the end of each period.
RESULTS: At end of fasting, FFM accounted for 74% of total BW lost during 
fasting. However, at the follow-up visit, the median (IQR) percentage change in 
total BW, FFM, FM, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass from baseline was -8.2 
(5.2), -4.4 (5.6), -14.7 (8.9), -15.8 (12.8) %, respectively. At follow-up, FM 
loss accounted for 67% of the total BW lost. BMC remained unchanged across all 
study visits.
CONCLUSIONS: This protocol produced sustained FM loss, specifically VAT mass, 
and FFM recovery, suggesting it may support effective weight management.

Oncocytic thyroid carcinoma (OTC) is often aggressive and refractory to 
radioiodine therapy, which is the current standard of care for metastatic 
thyroid cancer. The thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) regulates 
thyroid function and metabolism and is highly expressed in the thyroid gland and 
most thyroid tumors including OTC. Here, we report positron emission tomography 
(PET) imaging of radiolabeled TSHR antibody for detecting tumoral TSHR 
expression and monitoring TSHR chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy 
response in an OTC mouse model. Radiotracer 89Zr-DFO-TSHR-Ab was prepared as 
previously reported for PET imaging of TSHR expression. Tissue microarray 
analysis confirmed TSHR expression in both normal thyroid and OTC tumors. A 
human OTC xenograft model was established by subcutaneous injection of XTC.UC1 
cells into NSG mice. PET imaging and biodistribution studies of TSHR expression 
were subsequently conducted in this model to assess TSHR-expression change 
before and after TSHR CAR T-cell therapy. TSHR-targeted CAR T-cells were 
administered intravenously, and longitudinal PET/CT imaging with 
89Zr-DFO-TSHR-Ab was performed at 24, 72, and 120 h postinjection to monitor 
tumor response. Eight weeks later, the same mice were rechallenged with XTC.UC1 
cells in the contralateral flank to assess long-term therapeutic efficacy and 
immune memory through serial PET/CT imaging. PET imaging and biodistribution 
studies demonstrated that this radiotracer effectively detected TSHR-expressing 
OTC, with reasonable tumor uptake and imaging contrast. Following CAR T-cell 
therapy, TSHR PET showed significantly decreased tumor uptake, consistent with 
TSHR-targeted cell immunotherapy response with attenuated TSHR expression. These 
findings suggest 89Zr-DFO-TSHR-Ab enables noninvasive identification of OTC 
tumors and real-time monitoring of response to TSHR-targeted CAR T-cell therapy.

Cardiogenic shock (CS) remains a high morbidity and mortality condition 
worldwide frequently complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 
decompensated heart failure (HF). Within the management of CS, mechanical 
circulatory support (MCS) devices play a critical role in maintaining 
hemodynamic stability, preserving end-organ perfusion and bridging patients 
through to recovery, implantation of durable support or transplantation. Despite 
their use, optimal timing of initiation, as well as patient and device selection 
remain unclear. This review explores the current landscape of MCS devices, 
surrounding evidence and key distinctions between devices. With increasing 
acknowledgment for the heterogeneity of CS, understanding the strengths and 
limitations of each device remains crucial to improving outcomes in this 
high-risk population.

BackgroundWhile rapid response teams (RRT) are widely implemented to address 
clinical deterioration in hospitalized patients, their impact on goals of care 
(GOC) discussions remains underexplored.AimsWe aimed to evaluate whether RRT 
activations were associated with subsequent goals of care discussions, code 
status changes, and clinical outcomes.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective 
single-center review of hospitalized adult patients admitted to medicine 
services who had RRT activations between January and December 2023. The primary 
outcome was GOC discussion within 72 h of RRT. GOC discussions were identified 
through EMR documentation of conversations, code status changes, and ACP notes. 
Secondary outcomes included code status change, transition to comfort care, and 
30- and 90-day mortality. Analyses were adjusted using inverse probability of 
treatment weighting.Results1823 RRTs among 1677 patients were analyzed; 47% of 
patients were female and 88% identified as white. Those transferred to the ICU 
had higher odds of goals of care discussions (OR 1.52, P < 0.001), code status 
change (OR 2.43, P < 0.001), and transition to comfort care (OR 1.47, P = 0.026) 
compared to those who remained on the floor. ICU transfer was also associated 
with increased 30- (OR 1.39, P = 0.006) and 90-day mortality (OR 1.30, P = 
0.014).ConclusionsICU transfer following RRT activation is strongly associated 
with downstream goals of care discussions, changes in code status, 
comfort-focused care, and higher mortality. This demonstrates the importance of 
initiating goals of care discussions early and often, regardless of whether 
clinical decompensation is anticipated.

BACKGROUND: Women veterans are the fastest growing group of new Veterans Health 
Administration (VA) users with more than half a million using VA care in 2018. 
VA has implemented policies and programs to meet the reproductive and sexual 
health (RSH) needs of women veterans who increasingly rely on VA to provide 
comprehensive care.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to describe changes in the prevalence of RSH diagnosis 
categories among women veterans using VA care in fiscal year (FY) 2010 and 
FY2018.
METHODS: Repeated cross-sectional VA administrative data were used to identify 
women veterans using VA care in FY2010 and FY2018. RSH diagnosis categories were 
identified from International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Ninth (FY2010) 
and 10th (FY2018) revision codes for all VA-covered health care encounters. 
Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to adjust for age and compare the 
rates of 15 reproductive health diagnoses in FY2010 and FY2018.
RESULTS: Women veterans using VA for RSH care increased by 61% between FY2010 (n 
= 317,122) and FY2018 (n = 520,179). Prevalence of common RSH diagnoses remained 
consistent across fiscal years, including urinary conditions (SIR = 1.02; 95% CI 
[1.02, 1.03]) and reproductive organ conditions (SIR = .96; 95% CI [.95, .97]). 
Conversely, there were larger than expected increases in diagnoses of female 
infertility (SIR = 1.71; 95% CI [1.70, 1.76]) and sexual dysfunction (SIR = 
1.51; 95% CI [1.47, 1.54]).
CONCLUSION: As VA continues to build capacity to provide RSH care to women 
veterans, understanding changing needs is important for evaluating the impact of 
programs and policies designed to improve access to care.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with 
maternal morbidity, mortality, hospital readmissions, and significant costs to 
healthcare systems.
RECENT FINDINGS: The incidence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and 
maternal morbidity is higher in rural areas than in urban areas. The interaction 
of rural residence, race, and non-medical drivers of health can create 
significant barriers to post-partum care in rural communities. Novel models of 
care, including remote blood pressure monitoring, telehealth, and 
application-based approaches, may offer ways to reach rural patients after 
hypertensive pregnancy. There are significant opportunities to create novel 
multi-modal and multi-disciplinary approaches to post-partum care of HDP. 
Tailoring and evaluating the approach in rural communities is an important next 
step to improve care.

OBJECTIVE: To assess Advanced Bionics (AB) HiRes Ultra and Ultra 3D initial 
version (V1) cochlear implant electrode failures over time at four large 
cochlear implant programs.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort.
SETTING: Four tertiary referral centers.
PATIENTS: Patients receiving AB HiRes Ultra and Ultra 3D initial version (V1) 
devices as of December 31, 2022.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Failure rate, revision surgery, speech recognition 
scores.
RESULTS: Over a span of 7 years, 205 (42.6%) of 483 implanted V1 devices have 
failed. Device failure rate varied across institutions from 32 to 67%. Of the 
205 detected failures, 163 (79%) have undergone revision surgery, with 94% of 
revisions being performed with Advanced Bionics devices. Average time from 
implantation to diagnosis of device failure was 2.7 ± 1.2 years. Most patients 
(89.8%) with available testing were matched or exceeded their best prefailure 
speech performance after implant revision. After revision, patients had an 
average CNC score improvement of 24.7 percentage points over their most recent 
pre-revision scores and demonstrated average datalogging of 12.7 ± 4.1 h/d at 
most recent evaluation.
CONCLUSIONS: Comparison of patients across multiple high-volume implant centers 
confirms the presence of ongoing device failures. There is variability across 
institutions in the rate of revision surgery once a patient is diagnosed with a 
V1 device failure, as well as in the rate of device failure detection. 
Inter-institutional variability in failure rates may be explained by the 
variation in the routine use of electrical field imaging. Reimplantation with a 
new device typically results in a return to prefailure peak performance.
PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE GAP EDUCATIONAL NEED: To our knowledge, a comparison of AB 
HiRes (V1) device failures across multiple institutions has not been conducted.
LEARNING OBJECTIVE: To identify device failure rate across multiple institutions 
with different testing protocols.
DESIRED RESULT: Providers will have an improved understanding of the trajectory 
of device failures for HiRes (V1) devices over time.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV-Historical cohort or case-controlled studies.

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are common complications of suboptimally controlled 
diabetes, characterised by non-healing, high morbidity, infection, recurrence 
(40-50%) and mortality. Ultrasonic debridement technology has been used for >30 
years to treat cataracts safely and effectively, and animal studies have 
suggested that ultrasound debridement stimulates collagen turnover. This 
technology was applied in developing a system for soft tissue removal in tendons 
and elsewhere, with intended use in the elbow, knee, ankle, foot and shoulder. 
It was then modified for the treatment of DFUs. In this study, the rationale 
behind using this technology is discussed, the procedural technique is 
described, and photographic examples of treatment outcomes presented.

The Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) Scientific Documents Pathway was established to 
support the development of high-quality, evidence-informed scientific statements 
that advance the field of electrophysiology through the synthesis and 
communication of foundational knowledge, translational insights, and emerging 
trends. Unlike clinical practice guidelines, scientific documents are not 
designed to offer practice recommendations. Instead, they provide a framework 
for understanding scientific domains that impact the arrhythmia care community. 
The Scientific Documents Committee oversees the proposal review, development, 
and approval of these documents, ensuring transparency, balance, and 
methodological consistency. This executive summary outlines the core components 
of the Scientific Documents Methodology Manual, including document types, 
committee structure, proposal and review processes, writing committee 
expectations, conflict of interest management, and publication requirements. The 
manual is intended to support the HRS community, authors, and partners in 
understanding the process by which these documents are developed and how they 
serve the Society's strategic goals.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, with an estimated 6.9 
million Americans aged 65 and older living with Alzheimer dementia today, with 
this number projected to grow to 13.8 million by 2060. Amyloid and τ 
accumulation underpin our understanding of the pathophysiology of AD, with the 
abnormal accumulation of these proteins leading to neurodegeneration. With the 
recent approval of antiamyloid monoclonal antibody therapies for patients with 
early-stage Alzheimer disease by the Food and Drug Administration, there is 
renewed energy and focus on brain imaging for diagnosis, triage, and monitoring 
of patients with neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, PET imaging of amyloid 
and τ has revolutionized our understanding of dementia progression and staging, 
and influences patient management in the clinical setting. We aim to update 
radiologists on the evolving role of amyloid and τ PET in clinical practice, 
emphasizing the need for standardized workflows and the integration of molecular 
imaging data with other disease biomarkers. We also discuss the clinical 
implications of amyloid and τ PET, including their impact on diagnosis and 
treatment decisions, as well as the challenges of reimbursement and workforce 
capacity. With recent shifts in the AD management landscape, it is crucial for 
radiologists to keep abreast of recent advances in clinical practice, thereby 
ensuring effective patient care.

BACKGROUND: Although leadership competencies are recognized as critical to the 
practice of hospice and palliative medicine (HPM), the specific leadership 
content that matters most, and whether that content is taught in fellowships, 
remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to characterize the current state of 
leadership curricula in HPM fellowships and understand which leadership topics 
fellowship program directors (PDs) consider to be most important to include in a 
leadership curriculum for fellows.
METHODS: A needs assessment survey was sent to 194 individuals identified as PDs 
by the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (AAHPM). Descriptive 
statistics were used for analysis.
RESULTS: Most respondents reported that leadership topics are important for 
fellows to learn. Six topic areas related to communication and self-management 
were rated as having great need or were included in existing curricula by more 
than 60% of respondents. PDs identified ten topics to be of great need for 
fellows, all but one of which were included in at least 40% of programs' 
curricula. Negotiation was the exception being included in only 20% of programs' 
curricula. The response rate was 20%.
CONCLUSION: Respondents rated leadership topics as important for training, yet 
many topics are not included in fellowship curricula.

BACKGROUND: Fat grafting is a common procedure in plastic and reconstructive 
surgery. It is associated with several disadvantages and complications, 
especially in patients undergoing recurrent procedures. Researchers are 
exploring the implications of cryopreserving adipose tissue and stem cells in 
plastic surgery. This article aimed to evaluate whether autologous fatty tissue 
and adipose-derived stem cells obtained through liposuction can be safely stored 
via cryopreservation for future surgical use.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across 3 databases, 
including PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Ovid MEDLINE, using specific keywords, 
yielding 75 articles. Studies that were not written in English or conducted in 
vitro were excluded. Only studies published in English within the last 5 years, 
and focusing on the use of cryopreservation of adipose tissue, were included. 
After review, a total of 22 articles met the inclusion criteria and were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Cryopreserving adipose tissue and adipose-derived stem cells shows 
great potential in plastic surgery. Patient factors such as harvesting site, 
age, and obesity significantly impact the yield. The highest yield was obtained 
by harvesting from the abdomen and thigh. Additionally, cryopreservation 
requires cryoprotective agents, among which a combination of dimethyl sulfoxide 
and human serum albumin was most effective. Despite the advancement in 
cryoprotective agents, thawing adipose tissue results in cell death and impaired 
extracellular matrix integrity. However, cryopreserved stromal vascular fraction 
gel demonstrated fewer complications and better retention.
CONCLUSIONS: The cryopreservation of adipose tissue and stromal vascular 
fraction gel demonstrates promising advancements for future applications in 
plastic surgery and regenerative medicine.

Erythroblastic sarcoma (ES), the mass-forming presentation of acute erythroid 
leukemia, is a rare and challenging diagnosis. Given the limited number of 
published cases, the diagnostic criteria, immunophenotype, and molecular 
characteristics are not well defined. We describe 56 cases of ES (36 adult and 
11 pediatric cases from our cohort, and 9 pediatric cases from the literature). 
The median age was 60 years among adults and 1.8 years among children. An 
association with prior cytotoxic therapy or myeloid neoplasm was documented in 
10/36 (28%) and 25/36 (69%) adults, respectively, but was not reported in 
children. Bones were the most common site of involvement among adults (16/36, 
44%), whereas soft tissue or central nervous system involvement was most common 
among children (each 9/20, 45%). Adult and pediatric ES shared similar 
morphologic features with all cases showing mass formation of erythroblasts 
and/or involvement of body fluids. Immunophenotypic analysis showed that blasts 
were positive for CD71 (49/49, 100%), GLUT1 (12/12, 100%), CD43 (37/39, 95%), 
E-cadherin (38/44, 86%), and CD117 (39/51, 76%) but were mostly negative for 
CD45 (15/48, 31% positive). Strong and diffuse P53 expression was common among 
adults (21/24, 88%) and absent among children (3/10, 30% with dim/subset 
positivity). Although a complex karyotype was common in adult (15/17, 88%) and 
pediatric ES (8/12, 68%), TP53 mutations were exclusively seen in adult ES 
(17/19, 89%), at least 11 of which (65%) were biallelic. Instead, pediatric ES 
was enriched for gene fusions; specific fusions were identified in 10 cases, 7 
of which involved NFIA rearrangement. The prognosis was poor among both age 
groups; 29/37 (78%) patients died from disease with a median overall survival of 
3 months. Overall, these results show that adult and pediatric ES have 
overlapping morphologic and immunophenotypic features but distinct molecular 
profiles suggesting diverging pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Arthrometers are devices used to evaluate knee laxity by quantifying 
anterior tibiofemoral displacement. The purpose of this study was to assess the 
congruence of tibiofemoral displacement measurements between manual and 
mechanical knee arthrometers in anterior cruciate ligament reconstructed (ACLR) 
patients.
METHODS: This investigation evaluated 44 limbs in 22 subjects who underwent 
ACLR. All subjects were cleared for return to sport prior to enrollment. 
Participants underwent manual and mechanical arthrometer assessments of anterior 
knee laxity in the same visit. Both involved and uninvolved limbs were assessed. 
The magnitude of raw knee laxity measurements between arthrometers, inter-device 
associations, and rank-order significance of limb measurements were assessed. 
The impact of different post-operative training protocols on device measurements 
was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Mean tibiofemoral displacement measurements for involved and uninvolved 
limbs were comparable for the mechanical arthrometer at 134 N and manual 
arthrometer at 89 N (P = 0.33), however, mean displacement values varied 
significantly between the two arthrometers at 134 N (P < 0.01). Overall, 
significant associations between mechanical and manual arthrometer measurements 
were not observed. Rank order trended toward lower difference when comparing 
Side and Device (P > 0.06). Consilience between mechanical and manual 
arthrometers was not observed in this investigation.
CONCLUSIONS: Multi-center studies or literature syntheses that incorporate more 
than one type of arthrometer should focus on reporting delta values as the 
present data demonstrated no significant repeated measures deltas 
between-devices.

Platelets are small, anucleate particles derived from bone marrow megakaryocytes 
that circulate in the blood and are central to hemostasis, atherothrombosis, and 
post-angioplasty coronary restenosis. Initially thought to involve a simple 
process of platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation, recent insights 
reveal an important interplay with genetics and other organ systems, especially 
in the setting of antiplatelet drug therapy. Interaction involving the hepatic 
cytochrome P450 enzymes, which regulate drug metabolism, and genetic variation 
in those enzymes affecting drug response, underscores the liver's role in 
modulating platelet function by attenuating circulating active drug metabolites 
with eventual cardiovascular implications. Circulating adhesive proteins such as 
von Willebrand Factor and fibronectin also significantly regulate platelet 
aggregation, a process that is further influenced by varying shear conditions 
within the vascular system. The efficacy of antiplatelet therapies can be 
attenuated by such individual genetic variation, which can affect multiple 
cellular pathways involved not only in drug metabolism and clearance but also 
the drug target itself. Identifying these genetic differences allows for 
tailored therapy, enhancing treatment outcomes and minimizing adverse effects. 
Genetic variation, particularly in the CYP2C19 gene, influences individual 
responses to the most commonly used antiplatelet drug other than aspirin, 
clopidogrel, with certain variants leading to reduced drug metabolism and 
antiplatelet effects. Therefore, genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy has 
emerged as a promising approach to reduce ischemic events and minimize bleeding 
events. This personalized strategy requires an understanding of genetic 
variation, drug-gene interaction, and the liver's role in impacting platelet 
function, the coagulation system, and cardiovascular systems.

BACKGROUND: The 2025 American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) clinical practice 
guideline for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) and Periodic Limb 
Movement Disorder (PLMD) provides updated, evidence-based recommendations. The 
World Sleep Society (WSS) conducted an international review to assess the 
guideline's global applicability and implementation feasibility.
METHODS: A structured questionnaire was distributed to representatives of 53 
national sleep societies affiliated with the WSS. The survey addressed guideline 
familiarity, perceived applicability, agreement with 20 treatment 
recommendations, and availability of key therapies. Responses were analyzed 
using descriptive statistics and the within-group interrater agreement 
coefficient (rWG) to assess consensus levels.
RESULTS: Twenty-three national societies (43.9 %) from all inhabited continents 
responded. The AASM guideline was perceived as fully or partially applicable in 
most countries. Twelve recommendations were fully supported by the WSS, five 
partially supported, two (regarding dopamine agonists) endorsed with caveats, 
and one (dipyridamole) not supported. Key barriers included limited access to 
certain medications (e.g., IV iron, gabapentin enacarbil), regulatory 
restrictions, and divergent treatment traditions. There was strong global 
consensus on discouraging ineffective or harmful treatments (e.g., cabergoline, 
valproic acid), while the avoidance of dopaminergic agents generated regional 
disagreement.
CONCLUSIONS: The AASM guidelines received broad international support but 
require region-specific adaptation for optimal implementation. The WSS endorses 
the guideline's structure and scientific foundation while recommending flexible 
dissemination strategies and greater clarity in therapeutic algorithms. These 
findings support the development of globally relevant, context-sensitive 
guidance in sleep medicine.

BACKGROUND: The evolution of enhanced recovery pathways in colorectal surgery 
has enabled same-day discharge (SDD) in various procedures. Although early 
discharge after diverting loop ileostomy closure was first described in 2003, 
its adoption remains limited. This study aimed to analyze national trends in 
outpatient stoma closure; compare outcomes between SDD, short-stay (SS), and 
traditional inpatient (IP) protocols; and identify factors associated with safe 
early discharge.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis using the American College of Surgeons 
National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was conducted. Patients 
who underwent elective stoma closure were included. The study population was 
divided into SDD (length of stay [LOS] of 0 days), SS (LOS of 1 day), and IP 
(LOS of ≥2 days) groups. The outcomes were analyzed using unadjusted, 
multivariate, and propensity score-matched analyses.
RESULTS: From 2017 to 2022, 22,312 patients were included: 201 (0.9%) in the SDD 
group, 1833 (8.2%) in the SS group, and 20,278 (90.9%) in the IP group. Overall 
morbidity was significantly lower in expedited discharge groups (7.0% in the SDD 
group vs 6.0% in the SS group vs 11.8% in the IP group; P <.001). After 
propensity score matching, both SDD and SS groups showed comparable safety 
outcomes, whereas the IP group had significantly higher reoperation rates. No 
differences in readmission rates were observed between the groups. American 
Society of Anesthesiologists class > III, smoking status, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, steroid use, and dependent functional status were identified 
as independent risk factors for adverse outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Both SDD and SS discharge protocols for stoma closure are safe in 
appropriately selected patients. Despite evidence supporting their safety, their 
adoption remains limited. The identification of specific risk factors guides 
patient selection and suggests substantial opportunity for expanding the 
implementation of outpatient protocols.

OBJECTIVE: To develop and analyze a risk-adjusted cumulative sum (RA-CUSUM) 
chart as a potential method to monitor individual surgeon performance in robotic 
total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer.
BACKGROUND: Currently, surgeons lack real-time tools to monitor and enhance 
their performance beyond residency completion. While national quality programs 
exist, granular, individual-level data are crucial for continuous improvement. 
Previous studies suggest cumulative sum charts hold promise in identifying 
performance trends and outliers.
METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed data from 640 robotic TME cases 
performed by 12 surgeons at 2 institutions. RA-CUSUM charts were generated for 3 
outcomes: (1) complications, (2) operative time, and (3) length of stay.
RESULTS: The overall RA-CUSUM curves for operative time and complications showed 
an initial learning phase, followed by a plateau or downward slope, indicating 
proficiency or improvement. However, individual surgeon curves revealed 
significant heterogeneity. Three surgeons consistently excelled in operative 
time, while 5 minimized complications most effectively. Potential quality 
improvement could be implemented to drive performance toward positive outliers. 
No differences were found in unadjusted outcomes, including conversion, number 
of lymph nodes harvested, and positive circumferential margins.
CONCLUSIONS: The RA-CUSUM chart is a promising method for identifying individual 
surgeon performance in robotic TME. It could help surgeons, teams, and leaders 
identify improvement areas and benchmark themselves against positive outliers. 
Further studies are needed to explore the potential of RA-CUSUM for implementing 
interventions to improve surgical quality.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is comprised of >200 genotypes and has an ~8 kb, 
circular, double-stranded DNA genome. Transmission of HPV occurs through 
skin-to-skin contact and infection of squamous epithelial cells of cutaneous and 
mucosal surfaces. HPV genotypes are categorized as low- or high-risk (hrHPV) 
based on oncogenic potential. There are approximately 14 types of hrHPV that can 
cause several types of cancer, including HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous 
cell carcinoma (HPV(+)OPSCC). Detection of HPV(+)OPSCC is traditionally 
accomplished using p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HPV-specific testing, 
either DNA or RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) staining or DNA-based PCR of 
suspected tumor biopsy tissue. More recently, platelet-poor plasma (PPP) samples 
from patients with HPV(+)OPSCC have proven useful for detection and quantitation 
of fragments of HPV circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). ctDNA has been shown to be 
useful in determining treatment response and monitoring for disease recurrence. 
In this study, a novel droplet digital PCR assay (ddPCR) was developed and 
validated for the detection and quantitation of ctDNA from 5 hrHPV genotypes in 
PPP. Analytical sensitivity ranged from 7.71 to 19.45 fragments of HPV ctDNA per 
milliliter of PPP across five hrHPV genotypes. In patients with confirmed 
primary or recurrent HPV(+)OPSCC or HPV(-)OPSCC, testing of corresponding PPP 
samples (n = 32) by ddPCR demonstrated 90.63% (29/32) overall agreement with 
p16/HPV-ISH biopsy results. Compared with reference ddPCR assays performed at 
outside laboratories, our ddPCR assay yielded 90% (9/10) overall agreement. This 
assay may provide clinicians with a tool for monitoring HPV ctDNA prior to, 
during, and after treatment of an HPV-associated cancer.
IMPORTANCE: At least 14 genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) have been 
identified to have high oncogenic potential. While molecular diagnostic testing 
for HPV is widely available for liquid cytologic cervical samples, testing is 
limited for other sample types, including liquid biopsy samples, such as 
platelet-poor plasma (PPP). With the rising incidence of HPV-associated 
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV(+)OPSCC), laboratory testing is an 
essential part of patient diagnosis, management, and surveillance. Here, we 
summarize the development and analytical performance validation of a 
multiplexed, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) assay for the detection and 
quantitation of HPV circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in PPP. This assay may provide 
clinicians with a tool to address minimal residual disease for patients with an 
HPV-associated cancer.

INTRODUCTION: Microbeam Radiation Therapy (MRT) is a preclinical, spatially 
fractionated radiotherapy technique that delivers ultra-narrow synchrotron x-ray 
beams at ultra-high dose rates. MRT has demonstrated superior tumor control 
compared to synchrotron Broad Beam by triggering infiltration of CD8+ T cells 
and inducing a transient vascular permeability window. This study aimed to 
investigate the effects of combining MRT with Gold Nanoparticles (AuNPs) on 
tumor growth, while also assessing whether MRT could enhance intra-tumoral 
accumulation of AuNPs.
METHODS: Mice bearing B16-F10 melanoma in their ears were assigned to seven 
experimental groups, each receiving distinct combinations of priming MRT (150Gy 
peak-dose), AuNPs, Broad Beam (6.1Gy), and therapeutic MRT (400Gy peak-dose). 
MRT was delivered as an array of 50µm-wide beams spaced 200µm apart. Tumor 
growth was monitored daily, while 15nm AuNP uptake was assessed with microCT 
imaging, electron microscopy, and Image Mass Cytometry.
RESULTS: Priming MRT increased intra-tumoral AuNP accumulation by 2.5-fold on 
day 3 and 2.3-fold on day 5 compared to non-primed controls. Image Mass 
Cytometry showed that AuNPs distributed across the tumor stroma and concentrated 
at the tumor periphery, near areas with high vascular density and in M2-like 
macrophages. Combining priming MRT with AuNPs and therapeutic MRT achieved the 
best tumor growth delay and regression with a median survival to 39.5 days; 
significantly longer than the 17 days achieved with priming MRT, AuNPs, and 
broad beam. The sensitizer enhancement ratio of 1.38 highlighted the efficacy of 
AuNP-enhanced MRT.
CONCLUSION: Our study introduces a novel approach in cancer therapy, 
demonstrating that MRT serves as both a potent standalone treatment and an 
effective enhancer of drug delivery. MRT increased the tumoral concentration of 
AuNPs and could potentially do the same with other therapeutic agents. Our 
findings strongly advocate for the continued development of MRT-based 
combination regimens and highlight the clinical potential of this dual-mechanism 
approach.

Accurately predicting vertebral fracture risk in metastatic spines remains a 
critical challenge in clinical practice. This study developed and validated a 
QCT-based finite element analysis (QCT/FEA) approach to investigate the combined 
effects of baseline bone strength and tumor size on vertebral structural 
integrity. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was also calculated from QCT data 
to evaluate the reduction in bone density with increasing defect size. Nine 
cadaveric vertebral bodies were analyzed under varying tumor sizes (0%, 20%, 
35%, and 50%). The results demonstrated a strong correlation between 
experimentally measured and computationally predicted failure forces (r = 0.97, 
p < 0.001) and aBMD values (r = 0.96, p < 0.001). Vertebral strength decreased 
linearly with increasing tumor size. Importantly, the study revealed that 
baseline vertebral strength plays a crucial role in fracture risk assessment, 
often surpassing the impact of tumor size alone. Tumor size reduced vertebral 
strength at a rate 84% faster than bone density (p = 0.009), highlighting a 
greater impact of tumor defects on bone fracture force than on bone density. 
These findings suggest that relying solely on tumor size for fracture risk 
prediction may be insufficient. Incorporating baseline bone strength into 
predictive models significantly enhances accuracy and reliability, providing 
valuable insights for clinical decision-making and personalized treatment 
strategies. This study underscores the importance of advanced computational 
tools in improving vertebral fracture risk assessment in metastatic spine cases.

Norrie disease is a rare X-linked condition characterized by early childhood 
blindness and later onset sensorineural hearing loss. We report two male infants 
with genetically confirmed Norrie disease and characteristic ocular 
abnormalities consisting of bilateral funnel retinal detachments, anterior 
segment dysgenesis, and/or buphthalmos and microphthalmia. MRI demonstrated 
enhancement of the cranial nerves, cochleae, and cerebellum with cerebellar 
restricted diffusion. Intracranial findings mimicked meningitis, labyrinthitis, 
and cerebellitis. Neither infant showed clinical signs of infection. 
Labyrinthine and cerebellar signal abnormalities have not been previously 
reported in the context of Norrie disease. Clinicians should consider Norrie 
disease when encountering such findings and be aware that the described 
intracranial features of Norrie disease do not necessarily indicate CNS 
infection.

BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) clinical trials typically rely on a single 
primary endpoint to assess drug efficacy. This strategy fails to adequately 
capture the full impact of treatment in heterogenous neurological conditions 
like SCI. A more patient-centric analysis requires assessment of neurological 
function, functional capacity, and quality of life, incorporating meaningful 
patient-reported outcomes. The global statistical test (GST) addresses this 
challenge using a unified statistical conclusion regarding the superiority of a 
treatment strategy over another by evaluating multiple trial endpoints 
simultaneously.
METHODS: The RISCIS trial (Safety and Efficacy of Riluzole in Acute Spinal Cord 
Injury Study) data was analysed using a multivariate nonparametric GST, 
integrating the total American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score 
(TOTM), Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), and SF-36 PCS (Short Form-36 
Physical Component Scale) scores. In the RISCIS trial, patients with severe 
cervical SCI (AIS A, B, and C) were randomised to receive riluzole or placebo 
within 12 h of injury in a double blinded fashion. We compared six-month 
outcomes between groups using a modified O'Brien's rank sum test with sample 
variance adjustment. Higher summed ranks represent better global outcomes. The 
overall probability of improvement was computed using a summary estimate, the 
global treatment effect (GTE).
FINDINGS: A total of 131 patients (mean age 45.8 years old, 82% males) completed 
the six-month outcome assessment. Among these, 49.6% were classified as AIS A, 
20.6% as AIS B, and 29% as AIS C. Riluzole was administered within 12 h from 
injury for 14 days in 65 patients, while 66 received a placebo. The unadjusted 
mean change from baseline to six months showed a favourable response in the 
riluzole group compared to placebo across TOTM (p = 0.28 by t-test; p = 0.26 by 
Wilcoxon test), SCIM (p = 0.04 by t-test; p = 0.02 by Wilcoxon test), or SF-36 
PCS (p = 0.23 by t-test; p = 0.21 by Wilcoxon test) scores. Using the GST to 
simultaneously assess these measures, the riluzole group exhibited a higher rank 
sum compared to placebo [median rank sum = 207 (IQR: 166-246) in riluzole vs 185 
(IQR: 146-236) in placebo, p = 0.04]. Subgroup analysis revealed the greatest 
treatment benefit among patients with AIS A injuries (GTE = 0.16, 95% CI: 
0.01-0.31, p = 0.02). At six months, the probability that riluzole treatment 
resulted in overall better outcomes than placebo across all assessed outcomes 
was 58%.
INTERPRETATION: Riluzole was associated with improved global outcomes in 
patients with severe traumatic SCI, based on a composite score integrating ASIA 
total motor scores, SCIM, and SF36 outcomes at six months. Riluzole is a 
promising therapeutic option in SCI, but further investigation through 
higher-quality studies incorporating multidimensional assessments is warranted.

trial (NCT01597518) was funded by the AO Foundation, United States Department of 
Defense (DOD), and the Praxis Spinal Cord Institute.

BACKGROUND: Clinical characteristics, cardiac disease progression, and outcomes 
of "previously undiagnosed" family members of patients with hereditary 
transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTRv-CM) with pathogenic or likely 
pathogenic transthyretin (TTR) variants (genotype positive or G+) are unknown 
despite prognostic and therapeutic implications.
OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to describe the phenotypic 
presentation and report longitudinal assessment, including cardiac imaging of 
ATTRv G+ family members.
METHODS: Demographic, electrocardiographic, genetic, and imaging 
(echocardiography, cardiac technetium-99m pyrophosphate, and magnetic resonance 
imaging) data were abstracted and analyzed from the electronic health records.
RESULTS: There were 85 G+ family members, with the most common genotypes being 
Val50Met (29.4%) and Thr60Ala (28.2%). The mean age was 48.5 ± 11.7 years, 38.8% 
were male, and 17.9% and 15.5% had a diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy and 
carpal tunnel syndrome, respectively. The median follow-up was 6.8 years (Q1-Q3: 
4.1-9.7), over which 55 patients had follow-up imaging studies. Left ventricular 
ejection fraction reduction (63 ± 4 to 61 ± 4, P = 0.014) and progressive septal 
wall thickening (9.4 ± 1.6 to 10.2 ± 2.4, P = 0.037) were observed. There were 
only 6 (10.9%) patients who developed at least 2 abnormal echocardiographic 
changes consistent with cardiac disease progression. The risk of developing 
peripheral neuropathy during follow-up was 25.5% (95% CI: 8.9%-42.1%; P = 
0.004), but none were diagnosed with heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Previously undiagnosed ATTRv G+ family members have a greater 
prevalence and incidence of symptomatic neurological rather than cardiac 
disease, and the progression of cardiac disease was limited, which has 
implications for treating these patients preemptively.

AIMS: Left ventricular (LV) ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC) refers to the 
ratio of afterload (effective arterial elastance) to contractility (end-systolic 
elastance) as an integrated marker of cardiac performance. We sought to 
determine whether the echocardiographic VAC ratio, defined using the ratio of LV 
end-systolic volume (LVESV) to stroke volume (SV), predicted mortality in the 
cardiac intensive care unit (CICU).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mayo Clinic CICU patients from 2007 and 2018 were included. 
Ventricular-arterial coupling ratio was calculated as the Teichholz LVESV 
divided by the SV calculated from LV outflow tract Doppler. The primary outcome 
was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcome was all-cause 1-year 
mortality. A total of 4685 patients were included with a median age of 69 (58, 
79) years (37.2% females), with acute coronary syndrome in 54.9% and heart 
failure in 49.0%. A higher VAC ratio was associated with greater severity of 
illness, worse echocardiographic findings, and more use of critical care 
therapies. A total of 329 (7%) patients died during hospitalization. Patients 
with a higher VAC ratio had higher in-hospital mortality overall and in each 
admission diagnosis subgroup. After multivariable adjustment, patients with a 
VAC ratio >2 were at higher risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 
1.63, 95% confidence interval 1.17-2.28, P = 0.010). One-year mortality was 
higher for patients with a higher VAC ratio, especially VAC >2.
CONCLUSION: Ventricular-arterial uncoupling was associated with worse outcomes 
in an unselected CICU cohort. The echocardiographic VAC ratio is a simple 
non-invasive bedside measure that can be used for risk prediction in the CICU.

Background and PurposeRecent introduction of photon counting detector (PCD) 
computed tomography (CT) scanners into clinical practice further improve CT 
angiography (CTA) depiction of orbital arterial vasculature compared to 
conventional energy integrating detector (EID) CT scanners. PCD-CTA of the orbit 
can provide a detailed arterial roadmap of the orbit which can de diagnostic on 
its own or serve as a helpful planning adjunct for both diagnostic and 
therapeutic catheter-based angiography of the orbit.MethodsFor this review, EID 
and PCD-CT imaging was obtained in 28 volunteers. The volume CT dose index was 
closely matched. A dual-energy scanning protocol was used on EID-CT. An 
ultra-high-resolution (UHR) scan mode was used on PCD-CT. Images were 
reconstructed at 0.6 mm slice thickness using a closely matched medium-sharp 
standard resolution (SR) kernel. High-resolution (HR) images with the sharpest 
quantitative kernel were also reconstructed on PCD-CT at the thinnest slice 
thickness of 0.2 mm. A denoising algorithm was applied to the HR image 
series.ResultsThe imaging description of the orbital vascular anatomy presented 
in this work was derived from these patients' PCD-CTA images in combination with 
review of the literature. We found that orbital arterial anatomy is much better 
depicted with PCD-CTA, and this work can serve primarily as an imaging atlas of 
the normal orbital vascular anatomy.ConclusionWith recent advances in 
technology, arterial anatomy of the orbit is much better depicted with PCD-CTA 
as opposed to EID-CTA. Current orbital PCD-CTA technology approaches the 
necessary resolution threshold for reliable evaluation of central retinal artery 
occlusion.

Fundamental to medical education, gross anatomy first introduces medical 
students to human mortality, often provoking stress. Sense of purpose, a key 
aspect of well-being, may serve as a protective factor. We studied students' 
sense of purpose during an anatomy course, examining its links to performance, 
spirituality, and belief in an afterlife. Fifty medical students who took a 
7-week gross anatomy course in 2022 or 2023 completed the Life Engagement Test 
at the beginning, middle, and end of the course. We collected other data 
including demographics, religious/spiritual beliefs, and previous exposure to 
body donors. Practical and final examinations assessed course performance. 
Strong sense of purpose at the three measurement points was positively 
correlated with practical exam performance (r = 0.40, P = .004; r = 0.44, P = 
.003; r = 0.30, P = .047, respectively) but not National Board of Medical 
Examiners' anatomy subject exam performance. Staunch believers and non-believers 
in an afterlife maintained a stable sense of purpose, while students uncertain 
about the afterlife experienced a decline from the beginning to the middle of 
the course and even more to the end (P = .046; P = .008, respectively). These 
students also had significantly lower practical examination performance as 
compared to other students (95% CI [-10.84, -0.52]). In conclusion, a strong 
sense of purpose predicts better performance in a 7-week anatomy course. Both 
believers and non-believers in an afterlife do well, but students wavering in 
their beliefs experience a declining sense of purpose and lower grades. 
Supporting these students when they confront human mortality, including in other 
contexts such as palliative care/hospice settings, may be beneficial.

CONTEXT: Primary aldosteronism (PA) is a leading endocrine cause of secondary 
hypertension.
OBJECTIVE: To support the development of the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice 
Guideline on managing PA.
DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and others were searched on October 4, 
2024.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected by pairs of independent reviewers.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted and appraised by pairs of independent 
reviewers.
DATA SYNTHESIS: We included 95 studies (7 randomized trials and 88 observational 
studies). We did not identify trials that evaluated the outcomes of PA 
screening. One observational study suggested that screening was associated with 
higher rates of using PA-specific medical therapies and better blood pressure 
control. Patients managed with adrenal venous sampling (vs computed tomography 
alone) may have a better post-adrenalectomy biochemical cure rate, but with an 
increased risk of adrenal hemorrhage. Two small observational studies suggested 
that PA-specific medical or surgical therapy was likely associated with better 
blood pressure control than nonspecific therapy. Small randomized trials 
suggested that surgical therapy may be associated with better blood pressure 
control than medical therapy, with a lower number and dosage of antihypertensive 
medications. Compared to eplerenone, spironolactone may be associated with 
better control of hypokalemia and a lower number and dosage of antihypertensive 
agents. Unsuppressed plasma renin activity was associated with better control of 
hypokalemia, while suppression was associated with higher risk of mortality, 
atrial fibrillation, and stroke (very low certainty).
CONCLUSION: This systematic review addresses various aspects of managing PA and 
will support the development of the Endocrine Society guidelines.

BACKGROUND: HH2853 is a novel dual EZH1/2 inhibitor that exhibits superior 
antitumour activity compared to tazemetostat across various preclinical models. 
Here, we evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and 
preliminary efficacy of HH2853 in patients with refractory advanced solid 
tumours and non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs).
METHODS: This open-label, global multicentre, phase I study was conducted at 12 
centres in China and the USA, enrolling patients (aged ≥18 years) with relapsed 
or refractory solid tumours or NHLs. For dose escalation, seven predefined dose 
levels of HH2853 (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000 mg, orally twice daily for 
28 days) were evaluated using a standard Bayesian optimal interval with 
accelerated titration design. Two dose levels were selected for dose extension. 
Primary endpoints were safety, dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Secondary and exploratory 
endpoints included PK/PD profiles and preliminary efficacy. This study is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04390737.
FINDINGS: Between Sept 8, 2020, and Feb 28, 2023, 61 patients received HH2853. 
As of Jan 5, 2024, the median follow-up was 15.7 months (interquartile range 
[IQR], 13.8-17.7). Two DLTs were observed in patients at 800 mg dose level. MTD 
was not reached. The dose levels of 400 mg and 600 mg were selected for dose 
extension, and the RP2D was determined as 400 mg twice daily. Treatment-related 
adverse events (TRAEs) of any grade occurred in 58 patients (95.1%). The most 
common TRAEs were diarrhoea (n = 31, 50.8%), blood bilirubin increased (n = 29, 
47.5%) and anaemia (n = 23, 37.7%). The most common TRAEs of grade ≥3 included 
anaemia (n = 7, 11.5%), diarrhoea (n = 5, 8.2%), and platelet count decreased (n 
= 4, 6.6%). No treatment-related deaths were reported. Among 57 
efficacy-evaluable patients, 17 (27.9%) achieved an objective response, with 
four complete responses and 13 partial responses. Ten of 17 objective responses 
(58.8%) were observed in patients with epithelioid sarcoma (ES). The objective 
response rate in patients with ES was 31.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 
16.0-50.0), and the median progression-free survival was 16.0 months (95% CI, 
5.2-19.1).
INTERPRETATION: HH2853 showed a manageable safety profile and encouraging 
antitumour activity in refractory solid tumours and NHLs, with particularly

Management of the Clenched Fist in Adult Patients with Upper Motor Neuron 
Syndrome.

Fahrenkopf MP(1), Rhee PC(1).

The clenched fist deformity (CFD) in adult patients with upper motor neuron 
syndrome (UMNS), typically due to a brain or spinal cord injury, can develop 
from an imbalance of the extrinsic finger flexors relative to the extensors. 
This brings the fingers into a flexed posture across the metacarpophalangeal 
(MCP) and interphalangeal (IP) joints and places the fingertips close to or in 
contact with the palm. The intrinsic musculature of the hand also plays a 
contributing role to the flexion deformity across the MCP joints whose 
contribution to the deformity can be masked by the extrinsic flexors. Severity 
of the CFD is patient specific and ranges over a spectrum dependent upon the 
involved muscle groups and underlying spasticity, myostatic contracture and/or 
joint contractures. In addition to markedly decreasing function, patients and 
caretakers may struggle with hygiene in the hand and even develop wounds within 
the palm. Surgical correction of the CFD can be classified as procedures 
implemented for muscles with (functional) or without (non-functional) volitional 
motor control. Techniques encompass muscle-tendon lengthening, tenotomies, 
tendon transfers, muscle origin release (slides), joint capsule and/or ligament 
releases. A comprehensive review of the surgical approach to correcting the CFD 
for the hand with and without volitional motor control in the fingers will be 
presented. Level of Evidence: Level V (Therapeutic).

Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommends a blood culture 
contamination (BCC) threshold of <3%, with ≤1% considered optimal. However, 
there is not a standardized definition of BCC, and the effect of multiple 
definitions on BCC rates or what definitions laboratories use remain unknown. We 
surveyed 52 hospitals and analyzed 362,078 blood cultures (BCx) collected 1 
September 2019 to 31 August 2021 from 62 intensive care units (ICUs) and 231 
wards from 48 of these hospitals. We calculated and compared BCC rates using the 
College of American Pathologists (CAP) or CLSI criteria (both utilize a limited 
number of skin commensals to define BCC) and the comprehensive National 
Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) commensal list. We characterized factors 
associated with BCC and related outcomes (central-line associated bloodstream 
infection [CLABSI] and vancomycin use). BCC, BCx positivity, and single BCx 
rates were monitored by 100%, 39%, and 21% of hospitals, respectively. Hospitals 
used CAP (65%), CLSI (17%), and NHSN (17%) criteria to define BCC. Mean BCC rate 
by CAP (CAP-BCC) was 1.38% for ICUs and 0.96% for wards. BCC rates remained 
similar by CLSI criteria but increased when using NHSN list. Sharing BCC data 
outside of the laboratory, measuring additional BCx quality indicators, and 
limiting central catheter-drawn BCx were associated with lower BCC rates. BCC 
was associated with higher CLABSI rates in ICUs. This study demonstrated 
variability in laboratory practices and opportunities to optimize BCx 
stewardship.IMPORTANCEBlood culture contamination (BCC) is associated with 
patient harm and unnecessary use of healthcare resources. BCC thresholds have 
been established; however, multiple BCC definitions exist. There is limited data 
on how BCC rates differ depending on the BCC definition used, what definitions 
laboratories most commonly use, or their approach to other blood cultures (BCx) 
quality indicators such as single rates or BCx positivity. A cross-sectional 
multicenter survey and analysis of BCx data from intensive care unit and wards 
revealed that most laboratories did not track single BCx or BCx positivity rates 
and that there was variability in how BCC was defined. Additionally, BCC rates 
were influenced by the definition used. BCC was associated with increased 
central-line associated bloodstream infection rates.

BACKGROUND: Disparities in cardiovascular disease presentation and outcomes 
between men and women are well-documented. While intravascular imaging (IVI) 
improves percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes, its potential 
sex-specific benefits remain unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine sex differences in 
adverse cardiovascular events in coronary artery disease patients undergoing PCI 
with IVI guidance vs angiography alone.
METHODS: Systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases was 
conducted to identify randomized controlled trials comparing major adverse 
cardiovascular events (MACE) in men and women with coronary artery disease 
(presenting with acute or chronic coronary syndrome) undergoing IVI-guided vs 
angiography-guided PCI. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated using 
random-effects models.
RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials, comprising 14,812 patients (76.1% 
men and 23.9% women) were included. IVI-guided PCI significantly reduced MACE in 
both men (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.58-0.81; P < 0.001) and women (RR: 0.64; 95% CI: 
0.49-0.82; P < 0.001) compared with angiography alone (Pinteraction = 0.62). 
Intravascular ultrasound-guided PCI reduced MACE in men and women compared with 
angiography alone (Pinteraction = 0.86). Optical coherence tomography-guided PCI 
reduced MACE in men but not in women compared with angiography alone 
(Pinteraction = 0.86).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the underrepresentation of women in IVI-guided PCI trials, 
this meta-analysis demonstrates that IVI-guided PCI confers a comparable 
reduction in MACE for both men and women, suggesting its potential to mitigate 
the long-standing sex-specific disparities in coronary intervention outcomes and 
supports its broader implementation in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: Literature is limited regarding the relationship between cochlear 
magnetic resonance imaging fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal 
and hearing preservation after resection of vestibular schwannoma (VS). We 
hypothesize that increased preoperative FLAIR signal is associated with 
decreased odds of hearing preservation.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Single academic tertiary/quaternary care center.
PATIENTS: Subjects with histologically confirmed intracanalicular VS (without 
extension into the cerebellopontine angle).
INTERVENTION: Microsurgical resection via middle fossa approach.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A review of demographic, clinical, radiographic, and 
audiometric outcomes were performed. Hearing preservation was defined as 
American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) class A or B 
hearing. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed with SPSS version 29.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven subjects met inclusion criteria with median age at time of 
surgery of 47 (interquartile range [IQR]: 38-54) years; 92.60% were White; 
66.67% had AAO-HNS class A, and 33.33% had class B hearing. Postoperatively, at 
median (IQR) of 11.50 (2.10-38.50) months, 44.40% had class A or B hearing. On 
logistic regression analysis, a ratio of cochlea-to-brainstem FLAIR signal 
greater than 0.6 was associated with decreased odds of hearing preservation at 
11.50 months-odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.02-0.84. Age, sex, 
surgery duration, tumor volume and linear dimension, fundal cap of cerebrospinal 
fluid, and extent of resection were not associated with hearing preservation.
CONCLUSION: Increased cochlear FLAIR signal on preoperative imaging is 
associated with decreased likelihood of hearing preservation after resection of 
intracanalicular, sporadic VS via middle fossa approach.

While all facets of the health care workforce need to diversify, the veterinary 
profession lags behind in training students from underrepresented populations. 
The need to increase diversity among health care professionals is not limited to 
clinicians but extends to those generating new information through biomedical 
research. To address demographic disparities within the biomedical research 
community, we provide a summer research program for veterinary and undergraduate 
students from populations historically underrepresented in the biomedical 
workforce that is explicitly designed to foster science identity and 
subsequently increase participants' interest and success in pursuing biomedical 
research-related educational and career paths. We hypothesized that 
participation in this program would enhance science identity, confidence, and 
pursuit of research-related education and subsequent careers. Three validated 
survey instruments containing qualitative ordered rating scales were 
administered to program participants (N = 57) over the course of the summer in 
which they participated (2018-2022). Questions asked at two time points were 
analyzed with a repeated-measures linear mixed-effects model. Significant growth 
was reported in most topics surveyed over time. Many queries within gains, 
confidence, and science identity modules displayed significant increases over 
time or scored high in surveys at both time points. In addition, post-graduate 
educational and career outcomes were obtained for alumni (N = 130) of program 
years 2011-2023; their post-graduate enrollment rates (78%) markedly exceeded 
national norms. This multidimensional experiential research program, which 
holistically fosters professional networking and student confidence in 
research-related endeavors, provides quantifiable growth in research skills and 
science identity. These gains support students' persistence in research and 
biomedical-related educational and career paths.

CONTEXT: A national assessment of osteoporosis drug therapy (ODT) use can inform 
the extent of underdiagnosis and undertreatment of osteoporosis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim was to describe trends in ODT use by age, sex, fragility 
fracture, and documented osteoporosis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patient-quarter observations for 
adults aged ≥50 years with commercial or Medicare Advantage health insurance in 
the OptumLabs Data Warehouse between 2011 and 2022. The primary outcome was the 
proportion of patient-quarter observations with ODT use stratified by age, sex, 
fragility fracture, and documented osteoporosis. Cuzick tests were performed to 
assess trends ODT use.
RESULTS: Analysis of 166 673 420 patient-quarter observations revealed that over 
70% of patients with fragility fractures did not have documented osteoporosis. 
Among women aged ≥65 years with documented osteoporosis, ODT fill rates 
increased between 2011 and 2022 from 36.3% to 50.1% for women without fragility 
fractures (P < .001) and from 30.8% to 43.7% for women with fragility fractures 
(P < .001). However, ODT fill rates declined (9.2% to 7.4% between 2011 and 
2022) for women with fragility fractures and no documented osteoporosis (P = 
.015). Similar trends were observed among women aged 50-64 years and men.
CONCLUSION: ODT use for patients with documented osteoporosis has increased but 
remains low. Low rates of ODT use for patients with fragility fractures in the 
absence of documented osteoporosis suggests that underdiagnosis of osteoporosis 
contributes to underuse of ODTs.

The intention-to-diagnose principle, an analogue to the intention-to-treat 
principle in clinical trials, protects the foundation for inference in 
diagnostic test accuracy studies. This foundation provides for robust control of 
error rates during hypothesis testing and correct coverage probability during 
confidence interval estimation of accuracy parameters, in well defined 
populations for transparent generalisability. The intention-to-diagnose 
principle requires distinguishing between various non-positive non-negative 
(NPNN) test results, such as equivocal and invalid results, and appropriate 
handling of these distinct results during statistical analyses. Pragmatic 
application accuracy, pragmatic scientific accuracy, and explanatory scientific 
accuracy are three major research foci in studies of diagnostic test accuracy. 
Selection of appropriate analysis sets and appropriate handling of NPNN results 
depend on the specific focus. Selection has important implications regarding 
preservation of the foundation for statistical inference, generalisability, and 
comparability with results from other studies. We recommended analyses for 
diagnostic accuracy studies that include the estimation of accuracy parameters 
associated with each research foci. A free online tool is available to estimate 
these accuracy parameters. As with dedicated commitment to the 
intention-to-treat principle in clinical trials, commitment to application of 
the intention-to-diagnose principle will lead to studies with high integrity, a 
comprehensive understanding of the scientific and administration characteristics 
of the diagnostic test, clarity of interpretation and generalisability, and 
better clinical decision making.

PURPOSE: To compare same-day photon-counting detector CT (PCD-CT) to 
conventional energy-integrating detector CT (EID-CT) for detection of small 
renal stones (≤ 3 mm).
METHODS: Patients undergoing clinical dual-energy EID-CT for known or suspected 
stone disease underwent same-day research PCD-CT. Patients with greater than 10 
stones and no visible stones under 3 mm were excluded. Three radiologists 
selected the optimal reconstruction configuration for each CT modality and 
created the reference standard for renal stone presence. Two other radiologists, 
blinded to imaging modality, independently reviewed anonymized images to detect 
renal stones, rating confidence in potential stones using a Likert scale 
(1 = Definitely present, 2 = Probably present, 3 = Questionably present, 4 = Not 
seen). Sensitivity and false positive detections for PCD and EID-CT were 
calculated.
RESULTS: Twenty-one patients underwent clinical EID-CT followed by same-day 
PCD-CT, with the reference standard identifying 121 renal stones (mean size 
2.8 ± 2.6 mm). 0.4-mm PCD-CT images were more likely to display a stone as 
definitely present compared to 1- or 2-mm EID-CT images (p < 0.0001). Overall 
sensitivity for detection of all stones was greater at PCD-CT (0.75 vs. 0.55, 
p < 0.05). Pooled sensitivity of stones  ≤  3 mm was also significantly higher 
at PCD-CT (0.67 vs. 0.41, p < 0.05), with false positive detections differing 
between readers and modalities (PCD-CT vs. EID-CT: R1-7 v. 5; R2 - 7 v. 1).
CONCLUSION: Sensitivity for renal stones was significantly higher using high 
spatial resolution PCD-CT vs. EID-CT, especially for stones 3 mm or less in 
size, which may be important for at-risk patient populations. Prospective 
evaluation in larger patient populations that will benefit from detection of 
small stones is warranted.

Inotuzumab ozogamicin (InO) is an antibody-calicheamicin conjugate with high 
efficacy in lymphoid malignancies. It targets the B-cell surface protein CD22, 
which is expressed in most B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cases, 
albeit with variable intensity. However, factors governing CD22 expression and 
thus leukemia sensitivity to InO remain incompletely understood. Using multiomic 
characterization of 196 human B-ALL samples, coupled with ex vivo InO 
sensitivity profiling, we showed that early leukemia differentiation arrest at 
the pre-pro-B stage is associated with resistance to InO. Screening of 1639 
transcription factor genes identified early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1) as a key 
regulator of CD22 expression (false discovery rate of 7.1 × 10-4). When 
comparing the assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing 
profiling results of the most InO-sensitive and -resistant cases (50% lethal 
concentration <10th vs >90th percentile, n = 18), the binding motif for EBF1 was 
strikingly enriched in regions with differential open chromatin status (P = 8 × 
10-174). CRISPR interference targeting EBF1 binding sites at the CD22 locus led 
to an ∼50-fold reduction in cell surface CD22 expression and, consequently, an 
∼22-fold increase in InO resistance in ALL cell lines. Interestingly, within 
BCR::ABL1 ALL, we observed intrasubtype heterogeneity linked to EBF1 
transcriptional downregulation (P = 1.1 × 10-15) and/or somatic alteration (P = 
.004), which led to reduced CD22 expression (P = 8.3 × 10-11) and ex vivo and in 
vivo resistance to InO. Collectively, these findings point to the direct impact 
of EBF1 on CD22 expression during B-cell development, which, in turn, 
contributes to interpatient variability in InO response, even within the same 
subtype of B-ALL.

The treatment patterns and clinical outcomes for patients experiencing 
progression-of-disease (POD) following CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor 
T-cell (CAR-T) therapy for relapsed or refractory (R/R) mantle cell lymphoma 
(MCL) are undefined. We identified all patients who received CD19-directed CAR-T 
for R/R MCL therapy across 15 international centers and studied those 
experiencing POD-post-CAR-T in detail. We extracted 
clinical/treatment/pathologic variables and associated these features with 
survival outcomes, measured from time of POD. 384 total patients received CAR-T 
therapy and 135 (35%) experienced POD. POD occurred at a median of 6 months 
following CAR-T infusion and most (64%) patients with POD had complete response 
as best response to CAR-T. Tumor features at POD included blastoid/pleomorphic 
morphology in 29/78 (37%) patients and TP53 mutation in 21/41 (51%) patients. 
Following POD, 17 patients received no further therapy, 13 underwent local 
therapy, and 105 received systemic therapy. The most common first-line systemic 
therapies were chemo(immuno)therapy [22 patients, overall response rate (ORR) 
40%], pirtobrutinib (17 patients, ORR 36%), and bi-specific antibodies (BsAb), 
received by 13 patients, ORR 67%. Among patients experiencing POD, the median 
progression-free and overall survival was 2.5 months and 5.4 months, 
respectively, from POD. Lack of response to CAR-T and short time from CAR-T 
infusion to POD (<3 months vs. 3-6 months vs. >6 months), among other factors, 
were associated with inferior overall survival post-POD. In conclusion, we 
confirm the challenging prognosis for patients experiencing POD following CD19 
CAR-T for R/R MCL and establish a benchmark for future investigations in this 
patient population.

BACKGROUND: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary 
disorder characterised by the combined occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic, 
and pituitary tumours. Current treatments are based on very low-quality 
evidence. Our aims were to determine treatment outcomes in patients with MEN1 
for: subtotal parathyroidectomy versus less than subtotal parathyroidectomy for 
primary hyperparathyroidism (Q1); surgery versus active surveillance for 
non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours sized 2 cm or less (Q2); and 
dopamine agonist responses of prolactinomas in patients with MEN1 versus 
patients without MEN1 (Q3).
METHODS: We conducted three systematic reviews and one meta-analysis. Four 
electronic databases (MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, The Cochrane Library, and Web 
of Science) were searched from Dec 1, 2001, to Feb 13, 2023, with no language 
restrictions. Study designs included randomised controlled trials, prospective 
and retrospective cohort studies, and case-controlled and case series. Adults 
and children with MEN1-associated tumours were included in all three systematic 
reviews. For each clinical question, three pairs of authors independently 
screened abstracts and assessed the full text for final inclusion, discordant 
views were resolved by senior authors. Dichotomous outcomes were calculated 
using risk ratios or hazard ratios for time-to-event analyses, with 95% CIs. 
Continuous outcomes were ascertained using mean difference with 95% CIs. Where 
feasible, outcomes from individual studies were analysed through meta-analysis, 
using a random-effects model. The systematic reviews were prospectively 
registered (PROSPERO reference numbers CRD42023409912, CRD42023409936, and 
CRD42023409949).
FINDINGS: For primary hyperparathyroidism (Q1), 990 non-duplicate records were 
screened for title and abstract, of which 23 studies with 1073 patients were 
eligible for meta-analysis. These studies showed that subtotal parathyroidectomy 
had a significantly lower risk of persistent primary hyperparathyroidism (RR 
0·32, 95% CI 0·20-0·52; I2=0%) and recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism (RR 
0·78, 0·62-0·97; I2=27%), when compared with less than subtotal 
parathyroidectomy, although the risk of post-operative hypoparathyroidism was 
higher (RR 2·64, 1·63-4·29; I2=0%). For non-functioning pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours sized 2 cm and less (Q2), 1583 non-duplicate records were 
screened for title and abstract, of which three cohort studies were eligible for 
analysis. These studies showed that combined metastatic disease and mortality 
rates were comparable between patients in the surgery group (two [7%] of 27 to 
three [20%] of 15) and patients in the active surveillance group (one [3%] of 33 
to four [8%] of 50]). For prolactinomas (Q3), 475 non-duplicate records were 
screened for title and abstract, of which ten studies with 505 patients were 
eligible for analysis. These studies showed that dopamine agonist treatment 
failure rates to normalise serum prolactin were similar between patients with 
MEN1 (zero of one to one [33%] of three) and patients without MEN1 (four [6%] of 
68 to nine (82%) of 11), n=23 studies). GRADE certainty scores for all were low 
or very low.
INTERPRETATION: In patients with MEN1, subtotal parathyroidectomy achieved 
greater reductions in persistence and recurrence of primary hyperparathyroidism 
than less than subtotal parathyroidectomy; for non-functioning pancreatic 
neuroendocrine tumours sized 2 cm or less, the few available studies suggest 
that active surveillance might be comparable to surgical resection; and for 
prolactinomas, dopamine agonist therapy appears to have comparable efficacy as 
in patients without MEN1.

Contemporary Cementless Patellar Implant Survivorship: A Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analysis of 3,005 Patellae.

Historically, cementless patellar implants were fraught with issues of fixation 
and polyethylene wear. However, contemporary cementless patellar implants 
incorporate modern technologies for implant design and offer the potential for 
improved biological fixation and longevity. As such, an evaluation of the 
performance of modern cementless patellae is needed. The purpose of this study 
was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of contemporary cementless 
patellar implants used during primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), with a 
particular focus on aseptic loosening of the patellar component. A systematic 
review of the literature was performed from January 2000 to February 22, 2024. 
We included all peer-reviewed studies that reported the number of revisions in 
patients who had cementless patellae placed in 2000 or later during primary TKA. 
Reviews and case reports were excluded. Out of 639 studies, 13 were included 
with a total of 3,005 cementless patellae analyzed. The mean patient age was 64 
years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 31 kg/m2. Meta-analyses were 
performed to calculate the pooled revision rate per person-year of revision for 
aseptic loosening of the patellar component and revision for any patellar 
failure. Upon analysis of 13 studies involving a total of 3,005 cementless 
patellae, the revision rate for aseptic loosening of the patella was 0.2 per 
1,000 person-years and the revision rate for any patellar failure was 1 per 
1,000 person-years. Contemporary cementless patellar implants showed an overall 
revision rate of 1 per 1,000 person-years, demonstrating excellent longevity. 
The high survivorship, together with a low rate of loosening, show the utility 
and effectiveness of these implants. Given the nature of biologic fixation, 
these results are promising for long-term implant stability but additional 
follow-up is warranted.

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed outcomes following fenestrated and branched 
endovascular aortic repair (F/BEVAR) for thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysms 
(TAAAs) and complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (cAAAs) based on aneurysm size 
(small, medium, and large).
METHODS: Patients who underwent elective F/BEVAR for the treatment of TAAAs and 
cAAAs (only juxtarenal aneurysms) from 2013 - 2022 in the Vascular Quality 
Initiative database were included. Aneurysm size was categorised as small 
(< 5.5 cm in men, < 5 cm in women), medium (5.5 - 7 cm in men, 5 - 7 cm in 
women), and large (≥ 7 cm). Demographics and outcomes were compared. Survival 
was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression.
RESULTS: A total of 3 804 patients underwent F/BEVAR (small, n = 519; medium, n 
= 2 685; large, n = 600). Median patient age (small, 73 years; medium, 74 years; 
large, 76 years; p < .001), prior aortic repair (small, 14.3%; medium, 18.7%; 
large, 39.0%; p < .001), and treatment for extent II TAAA (small, 2.7%; medium, 
8.5%; large, 14.0%; p < .001) differed statistically significantly between 
patient groups. Peri-operative mortality (small, 1.0%; medium, 2.3%; large, 
4.0%; p = .004), any complication (small, 14.6%; medium, 20.0%; large, 19.3%; 
p = .018), stroke (small, 0.4%; medium, 0.9%; large, 2.3%; p = .003), and 
prolonged length of stay (small, 6.7%; medium, 13.3%; large, 17.5%; p < .001) 
differed statistically significantly by aneurysm size. Survival at 1 year 
(small, 95%; medium, 91%; large, 85%; p < .001) and 5 years (small, 87%; medium, 
80%; large, 65%; p < .001) also differed statistically significantly. After 
adjustment, patients with large aneurysms had increased 30 day mortality (odds 
ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3 - 10.1), long term mortality 
(hazard ratio [HR] 2.4, 95% CI 1.6 - 3.7), and prolonged length of stay (OR 
1.87, 95% CI 1.2 - 2.9) compared with those with small aneurysms. Compared with 
patients with medium aneurysms, those with large aneurysms had increased 30 day 
mortality (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.1 - 3.1) and long term mortality (HR 1.71, 95% CI 
1.3 - 2.2).
CONCLUSION: Large aneurysm size was associated with increased short and long 
term mortality in patients undergoing F/BEVAR. Improved screening may provide 
opportunity for earlier identification in order to decrease adverse events 
following F/BEVAR for large TAAAs.

AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the histopathologic features of 
MMF-induced colitis and colonic GVHD and develop a digital tool using deep 
learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to semi-automate the 
quantification of eosinophils.
METHODS: MMF and GVHD colitis cases were retrieved. A cohort of transplant 
patients who were at risk for developing GVHD and were on MMF at the time of 
biopsy was also identified. Cases were reviewed for histologic features and a 
deep learning CNN was trained to quantify lamina propria eosinophils. Clinical 
history was collected.
RESULTS: Ninety-five patients were included in the study group: GVHD (n = 37), 
MMF (n = 25) and GVHD vs. MMF (n = 33). Within the GVHD vs. MMF group, one 
patient was thought to have definitive MMF colitis and one possible MMF colitis. 
The GVHD group had a significantly higher apoptotic count compared to the MMF 
group (median: 7 vs. 2, P = 0.03). Neuroendocrine aggregates were present in the 
GVHD (N = 12) and GVHD vs. MMF (N = 4) groups while absent in the MMF group. The 
MMF group had a higher semi-quantitative eosinophil score and a higher automated 
eosinophil count as detected by the deep learning CNN (median eos/HPF: MMF 19.2, 
GVHD vs. MMF 3.6, GVHD 3.4, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Lower eosinophil counts, higher apoptotic counts and neuroendocrine 
cell aggregates favour the diagnosis of GVHD. AI models for eosinophil 
quantification may serve as an ancillary tool for assessing this differential 
diagnosis. Given the rarity of MMF-induced colitis in SCT patients, pathologists 
should have a high threshold for making this diagnosis in this population.

AIMS: Schistosomiasis remains endemic in various parts of the world, and 
insights into pathogen immunobiology are mainly based on experimental models, 
while studies on human tissues are limited.
METHODS: We explored the role of immune checkpoint pathway by evaluating the 
immunohistochemical expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in a 
retrospective cohort of patients with bilharzial cystitis. Inflammation severity 
by conventional histology and staining intensity by immunohistochemistry were 
assigned three-tier scores (0/1+/2+), and a cut-off for staining percentage was 
set at 5%.
RESULTS: 38 biopsies from 31 patients were considered adequate for evaluation, 
and positive staining was detected in 80.6% of patients (34 biopsies). High 
expressors (22.6%) showed strong positive membranous staining (score 2+) with 
high staining density (more than 5% of inflammatory cells). Low expressors 
(58.1%) showed mild/moderate staining (score 1+) predominantly in less than 5% 
of the cells (91.6%) or expressed restricted cytoplasmic staining (6/31). All 
high expressors showed severe inflammation (score 2+) (p<0.001), and viable ova 
were only observed in these cases. Calcified ova were associated with 
mild/moderate inflammation or absent/minimal inflammation, correlating with low 
expressors or non-expressors (19.4%), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Schistosomal granuloma exhibits upregulated PD-L1 expression 
proportional to inflammation severity and pathogen viability, highlighting a 
critical immune checkpoint engagement in disease pathology.

OBJECTIVE: The landscape of healthcare policies has undergone significant 
reforms, with a notable shift toward a patient-centered basis. This change has 
prioritized the use of metrics reflecting subjective patient-reported outcome 
measures (PROMs). However, these metrics are often limited, especially in terms 
of determining clinically relevant changes over time. The concept of the minimal 
clinically important difference (MCID) has been introduced to address this 
limitation. In this study, the authors aimed to assess the predictive capability 
of relative change and its corresponding threshold value, the minimal clinically 
important relative change (MCIRC), as an alternative to the absolute difference 
and MCID.
METHODS: Prospectively collected data from 2006 to 2021 were obtained from the 
Swedish Spine Registry (Swespine). PROMs included the numeric rating scale (NRS) 
neck and arm pain scores, the EQ-5D index and EQ visual analog scale (VAS), and 
the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Anchor-based methods were used to determine 
MCID and MCIRC. Absolute differences and relative changes were compared in terms 
of predictive power using the area under the receiver operating characteristic 
curve (AUC).
RESULTS: A total of 5323 patients were included. The chosen MCID values were -3 
for NRS neck pain, -3 for NRS arm pain, 0.08 for EQ-5D index, 13 for EQ VAS, and 
-30 for NDI scores. The chosen MCIRC values were -40% for NRS neck pain, -50% 
for arm pain, 323% for EQ-5D index, 55% for EQ VAS, and -33% for NDI scores. 
Relative change was superior for NRS neck and arm pain scores and NDI, while 
absolute difference was superior for EQ-5D and EQ VAS scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Relative change and its corresponding MCIRC were found to be more 
appropriate as a surrogate of subjective satisfaction when studying the NRS and 
NDI scores, whereas absolute difference and MCID was more appropriate when 
addressing EQ-5D index and EQ VAS scores.

OBJECTIVE: Surgery for mitral valve disease in patients with mitral annular 
calcification (MAC) remains challenging. There is no consensus on the ideal 
management strategy or patient selection, and perioperative and periprocedural 
morbidity and mortality rates remain high. The recent surge of patients 
presenting with MAC has been accompanied by increased interest in MAC surgery 
and interventions. This expert consensus document is meant to provide a 
simplified outline for managing MAC, including patient selection, imaging, and 
surgical and transcatheter therapeutic options, with a particular focus on 
conventional surgical techniques and hybrid approaches.
METHODS: The American Association for Thoracic Surgery Clinical Practice 
Standards Committee assembled an international panel of cardiac surgeons and 
structural heart interventionalists with established expertise in the field of 
MAC. A comprehensive literature review was performed by the panel and a medical 
librarian. Clinical recommendations were developed utilizing a modified Delphi 
method.
RESULTS: Expert consensus was reached on 33 recommendations, with class of 
recommendation and level of evidence, for each of 5 main topics: (1) 
preoperative evaluation for patients with MAC, patient selection, and 
indications for intervention; (2) standard surgical techniques in MAC; (3) 
hybrid procedures in MAC; (4) transcatheter MAC interventions; and (5) 
complications and bailout of MAC surgery and interventions.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the complexity and heterogenicity of patients presenting 
with MAC, consensus on several key recommendations was reached by this American 
Association for Thoracic Surgery expert panel. These recommendations provide 
guidance for cardiac surgeons and structural heart interventionists in treating 
most patients who present with MAC.

BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) stiffness is linked to pulmonary congestion and 
exercise intolerance in patients with acquired form of heart failure but has not 
been studied in adults with coarctation of aorta (COA). We hypothesized that 
adults with COA had increased LA stiffness, and in turn, worse cardiac reserve, 
pulmonary congestion, and impaired aerobic capacity compared to controls, and 
that LA stiffness index was associated with the presence of these abnormalities 
in the COA group.
METHOD: In this prospective study, 46 adults with repaired COA and 46 controls 
underwent exercise echocardiogram with expired gas analysis. LA stiffness was 
assessed at rest as the quotient for lateral E/e' and LA reservoir strain 
(E/e'/LARS). Cardiac reserve was assessed by exercise-induced change in LA 
reservoir strain, right ventricular free wall strain/right ventricular systolic 
pressure (RV-PA coupling), and cardiac output (CO). Pulmonary congestion was 
assessed by lung ultrasound.
RESULTS: The COA group had higher LA stiffness index (0.47±0.12 versus 
0.14±0.09, p<0.001), and in turn, worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, 
and aerobic capacity compared to controls. Within the COA group, those with high 
LA stiffness index (>0.42) had worse cardiac reserve, pulmonary congestion, and 
aerobic capacity. The correlates of LA stiffness index were high pulsatile left 
ventricular (LV) afterload, LV hypertrophy, and atrial fibrillation.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a mechanistic link between LA stiffness, 
pulmonary congestion, and exercise intolerance among patients with COA, and the 
correlates of LA stiffness index may provide viable targets for therapeutic 
interventions to improve outcomes in this population.

The long-term survival of patients born with congenital heart disease (CHD) has 
increased significantly over time, and as a result, there are more adults living 
with CHD than children. In spite of the improvement in the long-term survival of 
CHD patients, adults with CHD still have significantly lower life expectancy 
compared to the general population. The Mayo Adult Congenital Heart Disease 
(MACHD) Research Program consists of 2 key databases: 1) the MACHD Registry; and 
2) the MACHD Biobank. The MACHD Registry is a retrospective registry of all 
adults with CHD that received care at the Mayo Clinic Enterprise from January 
2003 onward. Offline image analysis is performed in the MACHD Imaging Core 
Laboratory. The MACHD Biobank project is a prospective database that became 
operational on January 2019. Patients enrolled in the MACHD Biobank undergo 
comprehensive cardiovascular testing. The manuscript describes the rationale, 
design, and baseline characteristics of patients in the study.

OBJECTIVES: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are the most common 
hospital-acquired infections in the United States, of which 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureu s (MRSA) accounts for 43%. 
Preoperative povidone-iodine nasal swab (PNS) is considered an effective and 
cost-saving treatment for Staphylococcus aureu s decolonization. We aim to 
assess the impact of preoperative PNS on SSI incidence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study utilized elective 
surgical cases between January 1, 2018 and May 31, 2023, at a single academic 
medical center. The cohort was divided into PNS and no PNS groups. The cohort 
was propensity-matched, and Pearson χ 2 /Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed to 
compare group differences. Multivariable logistic regression was utilized to 
compare events between cohorts before and after matching. An alpha of <0.05 was 
considered significant.
RESULTS: A total of 45,998 (22,999 per group) matched participants were 
evaluated. On multivariate regression, the non-PNS treatment group was 
associated with an increase in hospital overall SSI occurrence (OR: 1.48, P = 
0.02) but not specifically in-hospital methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus 
aureus SSI, MRSA-SSI, or any 30-day SSI ( P > 0.05). Compared with PNS treatment 
and prophylactic antibiotics, in-hospital SSI was higher in the absence of PNS 
treatment (OR: 1.83, P < 0.001), antibiotic (OR: 2.63, P < 0.001), or both (OR: 
2.06, P < 0.01). Compared with PNS treatment plus prophylactic antibiotic, 
in-hospital MRSA-SSI was only higher in the absence of antibiotic (OR: 2.92, P < 
0.01) treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative treatment with PNS may reduce overall in-hospital SSI 
but has no independent impact on MRSA SSI.

INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death in the 
U.S. Since the latest U.S. Preventive Services Task Force update, additional 
studies examining the performance of the multi-target stool DNA and the fecal 
immunochemical test have been published. This analysis builds upon the U.S. 
Preventive Serices Task Force analysis by including recent studies on test 
performance.
METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for manuscripts published between 
December 4, 2019, and July 9, 2024, using colonoscopy as the reference standard. 
Double-blinded reviewers screened articles. Primary outcomes were test 
sensitivity and specificity for colorectal cancer, advanced neoplasia, advanced 
precancerous lesions, and nonadvanced precancerous lesions.
RESULTS: Of 4,320 citations screened, 41 new studies were identified. After 
combining with 14 studies from the previous U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 
evidence review, 55 studies were analyzed. Forty-one studies reported the 
performance of fecal immunochemical test alone, 10 of multi-target stool DNA 
alone, and 4 reported fecal immunochemical test and multi-target stool DNA. Of 
14 studies evaluating multi-target stool DNA, 2 considered the next-generation 
multi-target stool DNA test's colorectal cancer sensitivity was 93.6% (95% 
CI=89.0, 97.1) for next-generation multi-target stool DNA and 71.6% (95% 
CI=64.3, 77.9) for fecal immunochemical test. Specificity was 91.6% (95% 
CI=89.2, 93.7) for next-generation multi-target stool DNA and 96.3% (95% 
CI=95.4, 97.0) for fecal immunochemical test. Advanced precancerous lesion 
sensitivity was 22.2% (95% CI=20.6, 24.0) for fecal immunochemical test and 
45.6% (95% CI=40.8, 50.4) for next-generation multi-target stool DNA.
DISCUSSION: This meta-analysis revealed that multi-target stool DNA has high 
sensitivity for detecting colorectal cancer and is more than twice as sensitive 
than fecal immunochemical test for detecting advanced precancerous lesions. The 
lifetime benefit and effectiveness of these tests should be further analyzed.

Whole-body magnetic resonance neurography (WBMRN) is a radiation-free imaging 
modality enabling comprehensive evaluation of the peripheral nervous system from 
the skull base to the knee. Using advanced sequences like isotropic 
high-resolution 3-dimensional short-tau inversion recovery and diffusion tensor 
imaging, WBMRN provides high-resolution visualization of nerve anatomy and 
pathology, offering insights into structural and microstructural abnormalities. 
It aids in diagnosing and monitoring conditions such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth 
disease, neurofibromatosis, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating 
polyneuropathy. This article outlines the imaging approaches used widely for 
whole-body MR imaging, and discusses indications, imaging differences, and role 
of WBMRN for evaluation of various neuropathic disease conditions.

IMPORTANCE: Burnout remains prevalent among physicians and can negatively affect 
quality, safety, and cost of patient care. Few randomized studies on 
interventions to address burnout have been conducted to date.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether wearing a smartwatch and having access to its 
physiological data (eg, sleep, step count, and heart rate) improves physician 
well-being (and if so, which dimensions of well-being).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial included 
physicians at 2 US medical centers (Mayo Clinic and the University of Colorado 
School of Medicine) who volunteered to wear a provided smartwatch beginning June 
7, 2023. The study concluded on June 27, 2024.
INTERVENTION: Six months of wearing a smartwatch.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Burnout, resilience, quality of life, depressive 
symptoms, stress, and sleepiness were measured using validated scales. 
Participants completed electronic surveys at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 
months. An intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: This study included 184 physicians (mean [SD] age, 37.5 [9.3] years; 
107 females [58.8%]). A total of 83 of 183 physicians (45.4%) were residents or 
fellows, 103 of 184 (56.0%) lived in Colorado, and 99 of 182 (54.4%) worked in 
non-primary care settings. Baseline levels of well-being across the measured 
dimensions were similar for the 2 study arms. At 6 months, 35 of 85 physicians 
(41.2%) in the intervention arm had burnout compared with 46 of 91 (50.5%) in 
the control arm (P = .21). Mean (SD) resilience scores at 6 months were 31.9 
(5.0) and 29.5 (6.2) among physicians in the intervention and control arms, 
respectively (P = .01). In multivariable analysis adjusting for baseline score, 
demographics, specialty, and work hours, the prevalence of burnout was lower 
(odds ratio, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.21-0.99]; P = .046) and mean resilience score was 
higher (parameter estimate [scale, 0-40], 1.20 points [95% CI, 0.11-2.28 
points]; P = .03; Cohen d = 0.17) among physicians in the intervention arm vs 
the control arm after 6 months.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial to evaluate the 
effect of wearing a smartwatch and having access to its physiological data on 
physician well-being, physicians who wore a smartwatch experienced improvements 
in burnout and resilience. Future research should explore whether engagement 
with smartwatch data leads to actual behavior change (eg, adaptive coping or 
reflective habits) that reduces burnout risk and enhances resilience.

PURPOSE: Computed tomography (CT) simulation is required for centers performing 
3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy and intensity modulated radiation 
therapy. Therefore, CT simulator downtime is likely to lead to delays in patient 
care. We sought to characterize CT simulator downtime within the African 
context.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: A pilot clinician survey was developed to evaluate CT 
simulator downtime frequency, causes, and workflow impact over the last year. It 
was distributed to African Organization for Research and Training in Cancer 
Conference attendees in November 2023 and through radiation therapy networks on 
the African continent. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data.
RESULTS: Responses were obtained for 22 CT scanners in 16 centers across 9 
African countries. Nigeria (n = 6) and South Africa (n = 3) had the most centers 
represented. Most centers (n = 10, 63%) had a single CT scanner capable of 
simulation, 5 (31%) had 2, and 1 (6%) had 3 scanners. For the 19 CT simulators 
with downtime information available, 11 (58%) were down for at least 15 days in 
the last year. Median downtime per episode was 3.5 days (IQR, 1-9.75 days). 
Three CT simulators were down all year, 2 of which were the only CT simulator at 
their respective centers. CT simulators were down because of intrinsic causes 
for median 8 days (IQR, 3-37.5 days) and extrinsic causes for median 1 day (IQR, 
0-7.5 days). Most machines (n = 17, 77%) were under an active maintenance 
contract. Most centers (n = 11, 69%) lacked access to an alternate CT scanner 
for simulation during downtime, whereas 3 (19%) maintained normal workflow.
CONCLUSIONS: CT simulator downtime is highly variable across the African 
continent and can cause significant disruptions in radiation therapy treatment 
at some centers. Intrinsic causes led to most downtime. These results suggest 
reducing CT simulator downtime frequency and duration or implementing 
simulation-free workflows may decrease patient delays.

IntroductionLower Extremity Extracorporeal Distal Revascularization (LEEDR) is a 
novel, preclinically tested technique designed to provide temporary limb 
perfusion in cases of acute limb ischemia when immediate revascularization is 
not feasible.MethodsLEEDR employs an extracorporeal pump and circuit to draw 
arterial blood from a proximal inflow site and deliver it to an outflow artery 
within the ischemic limb. The system is designed for bedside initiation using 
percutaneous access.ResultsALI from embolism, thrombosis, or trauma rapidly 
leads to irreversible tissue damage. Delays in revascularization are associated 
with high rates of limb loss and systemic complications. LEEDR offers a 
time-sensitive intervention aimed at mitigating these risks and preserving limb 
viability until definitive treatment is available.ConclusionLEEDR is a promising 
temporary perfusion strategy for limb salvage in ALI. This manuscript outlines 
its procedural components, technical considerations, and anticipated role in 
bridging patients to definitive revascularization.

RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To examine MRI characteristics of malignant 
tenosynovial giant cell tumors (TSGCTs) and elucidate features to differentiate 
benign and malignant TSGCTs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: With IRB approval, the medical record was retrospectively 
reviewed from 2004-2024 for cases of pathologically-proven benign and malignant 
TSGCTs evaluated by MRI.
RESULTS: 12 malignant TSGCTs (5F/7M, mean age 48.7 +/- 17.6 years) and 23 benign 
TSGCTs (13F/10M, mean age 43.7 +/- 18.7 years) were identified. There was no 
significant difference in age (p=0.45), gender (p=0.63), MRI signal 
characteristics (T1 signal p=0.57, T2 signal p=0.46, T2 signal heterogeneity 
p>0.99, presence of low T2 signal p>0.99), type of enhancement (presence of 
enhancement p=0.21, degree of enhancement p=0.12, heterogenous vs. homogenous 
enhancement p=0.21, presence of non-enhancing areas p=0.11), blooming artifact 
(p=0.065), or presence of perilesional edema (p=0.16) between benign and 
malignant TSGCTs. Four MRI features were more commonly associated with malignant 
TSGCTs: extra-articular location (p=0.009), irregular margins (p=0.0014), 
perilesional vessels (p=0.0014), and larger average maximal dimension (8.6 +/- 
8.4 cm malignant vs. 2.8 +/- 2.2 cm benign, p=0.036).
CONCLUSION: Although there are overlapping MRI characteristics between benign 
and malignant TSGCTs, malignant TSGCTs are more likely to exhibit larger size, 
extra-articular location, irregular margins and prominent perilesional vessels 
compared to their benign counterparts. Some malignant TSGCTs may not be 
associated with a synovial-lined structure on imaging.

BACKGROUND: Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) is an emerging arboviral pathogen 
transmitted by mosquitoes in the United States and Canada. It is associated with 
neuroinvasive diseases and a wide spectrum of clinical presentations.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at the Mayo Clinic Health 
System in Northwest Wisconsin from January 2018 to December 2024, analyzing data 
from 12 hospitalized patients diagnosed with JCV infection. This study aimed to 
characterize the clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome profiles of the 
disease. The cohort included individuals aged 19 to 75 years, predominantly male 
(75%), with all patients reporting outdoor activity and 75% being pet owners.
RESULTS: Only 27% of the patients recalled a mosquito bite. Among the cohort, 2 
patients acquired an infection during the first trimester of pregnancy and 
subsequently delivered healthy infants. Coinfections with Borrelia burgdorferi 
were found in 33% of cases, while 16.7% of cases were seropositive to La Crosse 
virus. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was obtained in 5 patients and 
was nonspecific. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated lymphocytic or 
monocytic pleocytosis in all cases where the test was performed.
CONCLUSIONS: All patients experienced clinical improvement, with only 1 
developing lingering neurological symptoms in the form of brain fog. This study 
highlights the clinical heterogeneity of JCV infections and underscores the 
importance of including JCV in the differential diagnosis for patients residing 
in or traveling from endemic areas.

Sex therapy is recommended for a range of male sexual dysfunction-including 
erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders, and low libido-but utilization 
remains low even when men are referred by their urologist. Here we aimed to 
identify patient-reported barriers and facilitators to sex therapy attendance 
and predictors of both compliance and perceived benefit. Men referred to sex 
therapy by their urologist for sexual dysfunction were surveyed. The cohort 
comprised 106 cisgender males (median age 43), of whom 49% were commercially 
insured, and 52% had ≥1 psychiatric diagnosis, especially anxiety and mood 
disorders. Overall, 59% attended their initial consultation. Patients with 
psychiatric comorbidities were more likely to attend (p < 0.001), whereas 
commercially insured individuals were less likely than Medicaid recipients 
(p = 0.002). Of the 23 patients who completed a follow-up survey, 17 attended 
their consultation, and most (71%) found sex therapy helpful and would recommend 
it to others. Barriers included shame, embarrassment, perceived dismissal by 
providers, scheduling conflicts, and low expected benefit; facilitators included 
provider credibility, personal motivation, partner support, and ease of 
scheduling. While stigma remains a significant barrier, patient motivation, 
provider expertise, and streamlined referral processes may improve attendance 
and integration of sex therapy into sexual health management.

BACKGROUND AIMS: Liver transplantation (LT) remains the only cure for severe 
polycystic liver disease (PLD). However, LT indications and strategies vary 
across Europe, resulting in (unwanted) practice variation and unequal access to 
care for patients with PLD. This study aimed to (1) identify existing 
PLD-specific LT criteria across European countries, (2) assess which criteria 
are considered relevant by specialist, and (3) map the variation in liver-kidney 
transplant strategies among patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney 
disease (ADPKD).
METHODS: National PLD-specific LT criteria were collected, and if unavailable 
ERN RARE-Liver representatives from that country were asked to provide 
information. An online survey was conducted amongst hepatologists, LT surgeons, 
and nephrologists managing patients with PLD. The survey assessed relevant LT 
indications/listing requirements, clinical case evaluations, and explored 
preferences for liver-kidney transplantation in patients with ADPKD.
RESULTS: Defined LT criteria for patients with PLD were available in only 8 of 
the 17 assessed countries and showed substantial variation. Sixty-nine 
clinicians (43 hepatologists, 15 surgeons, 11 nephrologists), predominantly from 
LT centers (75.4%), completed the survey. Key LT indications were recurrent 
liver cyst infections (78.3%), significant impaired quality of life (75.4%), and 
severe malnutrition (75.4%). In ADPKD simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation 
(SLK) was preferred by 40.4% of respondents, primarily due the favorable 
immunological profile (47.6%) and prevention of renal failure (33.3%). In 
contrast, those favoring a liver-first approach (30.8%), followed by sequential 
kidney transplant, highlighted the potential harm to the kidney graft during SLK 
(62.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Uniform PLD-specific LT criteria in Europe are lacking. While 
recurrent liver cyst infections, decreased quality of life, and malnutrition are 
widely recognized as crucial LT indications, they are insufficiently reflected 
in existing criteria, contributing to unequal access to LT. Moreover, 
considerable variation exists in liver-kidney transplantation for ADPKD 
patients, with a current lack of evidence to support one approach over another.

BACKGROUND: Left innominate vein aneurysm (LIVA) is a rare condition with an 
unclear cause. Only a few cases of this entity have been reported, and standard 
therapeutic guidelines for its diagnosis and treatment have not yet been 
established. There is no consensus about the optimal surgical access, 
thoracotomy may be the preferred method of treatment.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old male who was tentatively diagnosed with invasive 
thymoma via thoracic computed tomography (CT) was ultimately diagnosed with left 
innominate venous aneurysm via contrast-enhanced thoracic CT. The patient was 
asymptomatic. He was operated through a median sternotomy. A saccular left 
innominate venous aneurysm was discovered intraoperatively, and instead of 
reconstruction with a vascular graft or cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), it was 
treated with allogeneic pericardium placed with continuous horizontal mattress 
sutures and sternotomy closure. The procedure was successful, with no major 
bleeding event; to our knowledge, this is the first reported use of allogeneic 
pericardium with continuous horizontal mattress sutures for this condition. The 
postoperative course and follow-up were unremarkable, with no need for 
anticoagulant therapy and no evidence of recurrence observed at the 1-year 
follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Left innominate venous aneurysm is easily misdiagnosed as invasive 
thymoma and can be definitively diagnosed via enhanced thoracic CT examination 
or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This novel approach may offer valuable 
insights for guiding future therapeutic strategies.

BACKGROUND: The 2006 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease/Food 
Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network anaphylaxis criteria are widely used in clinical 
care and research. In 2020, the World Allergy Organization published modified 
criteria that have not been uniformly adopted. Different criteria contribute to 
inconsistent care and research outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop a consensus anaphylaxis definition, overview, 
and clinical support tool.
METHODS: A 12-member writing group developed draft outputs modified with input 
from a 46-member international expert panel, 31 medical stakeholder 
organizations, and 15 patient advocacy organizations. The expert panel 
participated in a modified Delphi process to seek consensus for the outputs 
using a ≥80% consensus threshold.
RESULTS: The first sentence of the definition reads, "Anaphylaxis is a serious 
allergic (hypersensitivity) reaction that can progress rapidly and may cause 
death." The definition also describes organ systems that may be involved and 
signs of life-threatening reactions. The overview includes details of 
anaphylaxis recognition and management. The clinical support tool incorporates 
new clinical criteria to help determine the likelihood that patients are having 
anaphylaxis, intramuscular epinephrine indications and dosing, and common 
findings from the anaphylaxis organ systems. In addition, 93.5% (43/46), 97.8% 
(45/46), and 93.5% (43/46) of experts agreed with the definition, overview, and 
clinical support tool, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The anaphylaxis overview is a novel educational tool conveying key 
elements of anaphylaxis recognition and management. We propose that the 
definition and clinical support tool should replace previous definitions and 
clinical criteria. The clinical support tool should facilitate improved 
anaphylaxis recognition and management across different clinical settings and 
standardize research outcomes.

Preterm infants frequently require respiratory support, including continuous 
positive airway pressure (CPAP), that imposes mechanical stretch on highly 
compliant perinatal airways. How this excess stress impacts airway development 
and function is not completely understood. Using human fetal airway smooth 
muscle (fASM), a key cell type in airway contractility and remodeling, as a 
model, we investigated the effects of stretch, focusing on the role of 
mechanosensitive ion channels Piezo1 and Piezo2. We found that CPAP-like static 
stretch did not alter Piezo1 and Piezo2 protein expression per se and had a 
minimal effect on fASM cell proliferation or IL-6 production during the stretch 
period. However, CPAP-like stretch produces long-term effects in fASM, leading 
to increased cell proliferation and IL-6 production during the poststretch 
period, though interestingly, it does not enhance extracellular matrix 
deposition. The role of Piezo channels appears context-dependent in that the 
Piezo1 antagonist GsMTx4 reduced baseline proliferation in nonstretched cells 
but slightly increased proliferation in stretched cells. Piezo1 and Piezo2 
inhibition did not alter IL-6 production. These results suggest that stretch 
induces a sustained increase in cell proliferation and inflammatory responses, 
which may contribute to long-term remodeling in former preterm infants initially 
exposed to CPAP.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mechanical stretch associated with respiratory 
support can impair airway development and function in neonates, but the 
mechanisms are not fully understood. Using developing human airway smooth muscle 
cells exposed to cyclic forces with static stretch to mimic continuous positive 
airway pressure, we found that stretch dysregulates long-term cell proliferation 
and inflammatory cytokine production, and mechanosensitive Piezo ion channels 
may play a role in the proliferation response.

Due to extensive pathophysiological changes in critically ill patients, standard 
dosing of antibiotics may lead to inadequate drug exposure. This is concerning, 
as insufficient plasma drug concentrations may lead to treatment failure, 
whereas excessive drug exposure may increase the risk of toxic adverse events. 
The role of inflammation as a factor influencing the pharmacokinetics (PK) and 
pharmacodynamics (PD) of antibiotics remains largely unknown. PK/PD target 
attainment of antibiotics can be improved through therapeutic drug monitoring, 
i.e., measurement of drug concentrations in the blood with subsequent dosage 
adjustment to reach a certain target. Besides, population PK models may be used 
to predict drug exposure and tailor dosing in an individual patient 
(model-informed precision dosing). Inflammatory biomarkers have been proposed to 
measure inflammation levels and guide antibiotic treatment. However, their 
potential to guide antibiotic dosing is unclear. This narrative review describes 
associations between inflammation and PK/PD of antibiotics in critically ill 
patients, and the role of biomarkers, therapeutic drug monitoring and 
model-informed precision dosing in improving antibiotic dosing. A focus of 
future research should be on the interplay between inflammation and PK/PD of 
antibiotics by including inflammatory biomarkers in PK/PD models and using big 
data to predict antibiotic exposure in critically ill patients.

BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a heterogeneous syndrome with high mortality. 
The need for a new taxonomy of HF is recognized; up to now, such phenomapping 
efforts have primarily used clinical data. Proteomics offers potential for more 
precise phenotypic identification and mechanistic insights. However, few 
phenomapping studies have used this approach, and all have focused on targeted 
cardiovascular proteomics panels and a restricted HF ejection fraction group.
METHODS: We measured over 7000 plasma proteins in a population-based cohort of 
1351 patients with HF, used k-means clustering to identify distinct phenogroups, 
and compared their clinical characteristics and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Three proteomics-defined phenogroups were identified, with substantial 
differences in survival (phenogroup 1 5-year survival probability, 65% [95% CI, 
61%-68%]; phenogroup 2, 45% [40%-51%]; phenogroup 3, 26% [22%-30%]), independent 
of clinical characteristics. Phenogroups also exhibited differences in several 
measures suggesting poorer health, including NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type 
natriuretic peptide), kidney function, and Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic 
Heart Failure scores, but did not differ by ejection fraction or New York Heart 
Association class.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that molecular phenomapping can stratify 
patients with HF into distinct subgroups that go beyond predefined clinical 
classifications.

Bronchiectasis is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by a 
self-perpetuating vortex of impaired mucociliary clearance, persistent 
infection, and progressive structural lung damage. While inflammation is central 
to disease activity and progression, targeted anti-inflammatory treatments have 
been limited. Understanding the different types of inflammation involved and 
their significant overlap is essential for effective management. This review 
explores key inflammation patterns, biomarkers, and available treatments across 
the spectrum of inflammation in bronchiectasis, with a particular focus on 
non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in adults. Neutrophilic inflammation remains 
the hallmark of bronchiectasis, with promising reversible dipeptidyl peptidase-1 
inhibitors reducing the activation of neutrophil serine proteases during 
neutrophil maturation. Eosinophilic inflammation has also gained attention, with 
evidence indicating that patients with this endotype may benefit from 
glucocorticoids and biologic therapies targeting type 2 inflammation. Additional 
inflammatory mechanisms discussed here include impaired epithelial function and 
mucociliary abnormalities, immune dysregulation, and airway inflammation 
triggered by infections, environmental irritants, and autoimmune conditions. 
Written for general clinicians, this review simplifies complex concepts, 
underscores key aspects of diagnostic evaluation, and discusses both 
conventional and emerging treatments for bronchiectasis, providing practical 
insights for improved personalized patient care.

INTRODUCTION: This study evaluates the feasibility of utilizing a 
commercial-grade 3D LiDAR/RGB camera, combined with 3D reconstruction software, 
to create an accurate and hyper-realistic digital model of a proton therapy 
treatment room. This reconstructed model aims to enhance collision avoidance 
strategies and improve 3D machine model accessibility. Utilization of a 3D 
LiDAR/RGB camera as a radiotherapy environment modeling has not been reported 
prior.
METHODS: To create a comprehensive 3D model of a half-gantry proton therapy 
system, colored point cloud data was captured using the Matterport Pro 3 camera, 
a hybrid LiDAR and RGB imaging system with high-resolution capabilities (134.2 
MP), a 360° horizontal field of view, and 20 mm accuracy at 10 m. A total of 117 
acquisition points, distributed across the treatment room with three camera 
heights, ensured complete coverage and minimal occlusions. Scanning, completed 
in under 3 hours, was monitored in real time using the Matterport App. Post-scan 
processing involved denoising and converting the point cloud into 3D mesh 
structures using MeshLab, followed by refined pair-wise iterative closest point 
(ICP) alignments. Textures and materials were assigned to reflect real-world 
objects, and a ray-tracing engine simulated realistic lighting in Blender. 
Animations illustrating the kinematics of the treatment couch and gantry were 
simulated in Blender for enhanced visualization.
RESULTS: The scanning process achieved complete data capture without missing 
information, attributed to strategic oversampling during data acquisition. The 
mean root mean square error (RMSE) of the ICP registration was 0.008 m. The 
validation process confirmed that the dimensions of the treatment couch within 
the digital model closely matched the actual measurements with less than 2 cm 
deviation, indicating high accuracy. The resulting digital twin provided a 
photorealistic and immersive representation of the proton therapy treatment 
room, serving as a valuable digital asset for various applications.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to generate vendor-independent and highly accurate 3D 
models of the proton treatment room environment with a commercial grade 
LiDAR/RGB camera to expand future research opportunities and education 
endeavors.

OBJECTIVE: To examine comfort (C) and threshold (T) levels in adult cochlear 
implant (CI) recipients over the first 18 months postactivation.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of longitudinal CI programming data.
SETTING: Tertiary academic center.
PATIENTS: A total of 480 CIs among 428 adult CI recipients.
INTERVENTIONS: Cochlear implantation with Cochlear Ltd. devices with subsequent 
programming to behavioral standards using Custom Sound® fitting software.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Charge levels needed to achieve C and T levels were 
measured longitudinally using Custom Sound®, from time of activation to a 
minimum of 6 and a maximum of 18 months postactivation. Charge (nC) levels were 
calculated as the product of pulse width (μs) and current amplitude (μA) to 
standardize among implant models. Changes in C and T charge levels over time 
were evaluated using repeated-measures analysis of variance.
RESULTS: When considering the entire electrode, the largest increases were seen 
at 1 month postactivation, and C and T charge levels did not increase 
significantly after 6 and 12 months, respectively. These findings were 
consistent across patient age at implantation and sex. When considering proximal 
electrodes only, C and T levels did not increase significantly after 6 months. 
In distal electrodes only, C levels did not increase significantly after 6 
months, but T levels continued to demonstrate small, but statistically 
significant increases up to 18 months postactivation.
CONCLUSIONS: Across the entire electrode, we observed the largest changes in C 
and T charge levels at 1 month postactivation. Small increases in C and T levels 
continued out to 6 and 12 months, respectively, but may be of limited clinical 
significance. The stability of programming levels over time may support 
selective de-escalation of CI follow-up after the initial postactivation period, 
but, given small yet persistent increases with time, most notably in the distal 
electrodes, alternatives for follow-up or remote programming may still be 
encouraged.

BACKGROUND: Total mesorectal excision (TME) is known to adversely impact 
functional outcomes. In a recent Phase II multicenter prospective trial, 
significant decline in defecatory and sexual function and fecal 
incontinence-related quality of life (FIQL) was documented following transanal 
TME (taTME) for rectal cancer, with neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) identified as a 
predictor of worse function. However, the impact of NAT on baseline function is 
poorly understood.
METHODS: Patients in a Phase II multicenter trial (NCT03144765) who underwent 
taTME with or without NAT completed validated functional questionnaires 
assessing fecal incontinence (FIQL, Wexner), defecatory function (COREFO), 
urinary function (IPSS), and sexual function (male: IIEF, female: FSFI). Data 
were collected pre-NAT, post-NAT, 3-4 months after ileostomy closure (FQ1), and 
12-18 months post-taTME (FQ2). Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon tests compared scores 
between timepoints.
RESULTS: Of 71 patients who received NAT, 10 completed both pre- and post-NAT 
surveys. Median age was 58 years [IQR 48-61], and 7 patients were male. Tumors 
were located a median 4.75 cm [IQR 4.0-6.0 cm] from the anal verge. Median 
baseline COREFO score was 38.1 [29.2-49.8], indicating baseline defecatory 
dysfunction. No significant differences were observed between pre- and post-NAT 
scores, though FIQL scores demonstrated a trend toward worse 
incontinence-related quality of life post-NAT (p = 0.06). Postoperatively, 
Wexner, FIQL, and COREFO worsened from baseline and post-NAT levels, with 
partial improvement at 18 months post-op, without returning to baseline. No 
differences were observed in IPSS scores. IIEF scores showed no new erectile 
dysfunction post-NAT, but low sample size precluded FSFI analysis.
CONCLUSION: Defecatory, urinary, and sexual function were not significantly 
altered by NAT, though FIQL trends suggest worsening incontinence-related 
quality of life. Assessment of function and health-related quality of life at 
baseline and after each phase of therapy may help better inform patients about 
the impact of multimodal rectal cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Gemcitabine, cisplatin, and durvalumab (GCD) have previously 
demonstrated favorable outcomes in advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), leading to 
their approval as first-line therapy. This study evaluates the feasibility of 
GCD for borderline resectable CCA in the neoadjuvant setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with borderline resectable CCA receiving 
neoadjuvant GCD between April 2022 and July 2024 were included. Treatment 
response (radiologic and pathologic), tolerability, postoperative morbidity, and 
survival outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS: Of 106 screened patients, 26 with anatomically or biologically 
borderline resectable disease received neoadjuvant GCD, with 12 proceeding to 
surgery (conversion rate: 46.2%). Extended resections were performed with 
extrahepatic bile duct resection (33.3%) and vascular reconstruction (25%). 
Tumor size reduction was observed in all resected patients, with RECIST showing 
stable disease in 83.3% and partial response in 16.7%. Pathologic response 
varied with no/minimal response in 41.7%, partial regression in 50.0%, and one 
complete response (8.3%). Postoperative morbidity (≥ grade III) was 50.0%, with 
0% 90-day mortality. As of April 2025, 91.7% of resected patients were alive, 
although three developed recurrences (RFS: 5.5, 5.7, 6.8 months). Overall 
survival (OS) was significantly longer in resected versus non-resected patients 
(median OS: not reached versus 20.8 months, p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that neoadjuvant GCD is safe and well tolerated 
prior to extensive liver resection for borderline resectable CCA. A conversion 
rate of 46.2% suggests that GCD might be a promising treatment for patients with 
anatomically and biologically borderline resectable CCA. Heterogeneity of 
pathologic response rate highlights the need for biomarker-directed correlative 
studies in future investigations.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and clinical outcomes 
of neoadjuvant triplet therapy with gemcitabine, cisplatin, and nab-paclitaxel 
(GAP) for patients with borderline resectable cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Given 
the surgical complexity associated with borderline resectable disease, the study 
sought to explore whether GAP could serve as a suitable neoadjuvant regimen to 
enable conversion to resection and improve prognosis in this high-risk setting.
METHODS: The study enrolled patients with borderline resectable CCA receiving 
neoadjuvant GAP between July 2019 and February 2024. Rates of conversion to 
surgery, perioperative safety, radiologic and pathologic treatment responses, 
and survival outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of 108 screened patients, 71 (65.7%) with anatomically or biologically 
borderline resectable CCA received neoadjuvant GAP therapy, 34 (47.9%) of whom 
underwent curative-intent resection. Among the resected patients, 50.0% 
underwent extended hepatectomy, 32.4% underwent extrahepatic bile duct 
resection, and 14.7% underwent vascular reconstruction. Radiologic evaluation 
showed an overall response rate of 50.0% and a disease control rate of 94.1%. 
Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were observed in 21% of the patients, 
primarily involving hematologic toxicities. Major postoperative complications 
occurred for 35.3% of the patients, with no 90-day mortalities. The resected 
patients demonstrated significantly better overall survival (OS) than the 
non-resected patients (median OS, 68.7 vs. 24.4 months; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Neoadjuvant GAP demonstrated promising efficacy for borderline 
resectable CCA, with favorable response rates and the potential to facilitate 
curative-intent resection. However, its use is mitigated by treatment-related 
toxicity, emphasizing the significance of careful patient selection. Further 
prospective studies are warranted to validate its role in optimizing surgical 
and long-term oncologic outcomes.

The effectiveness of T cell-based immunotherapy depends on durable T-cell 
responses that can efficiently eliminate tumor cells. NKG7 was discovered three 
decades ago as a protein associated with lytic granules. However, only studies 
published over the past 5 years have contributed substantially to our 
understanding of NKG7 in T-cell biology. NKG7 has been recognized as an 
important T-cell functional marker in responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor 
therapy and in the prognosis of certain cancers. Besides its role in the 
generation, trafficking, and release of lytic granules, which is critical for 
efficient T-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells, NKG7 has been identified as a 
key negative regulator of mTORC1 activity. By restraining mTORC1 activity, NKG7 
promotes T-cell longevity and memory generation after infection. Importantly, 
NKG7 upregulation has demonstrated therapeutic potential in preclinical T-cell 
therapy for cancer. Collectively, NKG7 is emerging as a promising biomarker and 
therapeutic addition to T cell-based immunotherapies.

BACKGROUND: While conservative treatment constitutes the mainstay of treatment 
for vertebral osteomyelitis (VO), aggressive surgical debridement is often 
warranted. We aim to assess the effectiveness of corpectomy for VO regarding 
neurological improvement, fusion, and infection recurrence.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies 
investigating outcomes after corpectomy for VO. Random-effects model 
meta-analysis was performed, with neurological improvement being the primary 
endpoint. Subgroup analyses were conducted by anatomic location (cervical, 
thoracic, and lumbar) and cage type (expandable versus nonexpendable).
RESULTS: Forty-four studies yielding 140 patients with a mean follow-up of 
25.5 months were analyzed. The mean age at surgery was 57.3 years. Preoperative 
neurological deficits were present in 78.4 % of patients (95 % CI: 63.6 - 91 %); 
they improved in 71.8 % of these patients (95 % CI: 56.1 - 85.8 %). 
Complications occurred in 10.4 % (95 %CI: 2.5 - 21.2 %). Preoperative 
neurological deficits were more common in the cervical compared to the thoracic 
(p < 0.01) and lumbar (p = 0.02) subgroups. No significant differences were 
observed regarding neurological improvement (p = 0.1) and complications 
(p = 0.6) among subgroups. Infection recurrence occurred in 4 patients (2.9 %), 
and 7 patients required revision (5 %). Subgroup analysis by cage type revealed 
no differences in preoperative neurological deficits (p = 0.1), neurological 
improvement (p = 0.9), and complications (p = 0.9).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis demonstrated high rates of neurological 
improvement, and low risk of postoperative complications and revisions among VO 
patients undergoing corpectomy. These findings highlight the safety and 
effectiveness of corpectomy in managing medically refractory VO or VO with 
neurological compromise.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) can occur in the 
absence of easily identifiable osseoligamentous abnormalities, such as fractures 
and dislocations. The role of surgery in the management of this condition 
remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies 
investigating outcomes after surgical management of cervical SCI without 
fracture and dislocation. Random-effects model meta-analysis was performed, with 
neurological improvement and time to surgery as primary end points. Subgroup 
analysis by time to surgery was performed to assess neurological improvement 
between patients undergoing surgery within 72 hours of injury vs later than 72 
hours after injury.
RESULTS: A total of 16 studies yielding 398 surgically treated patients with 
this condition were analyzed. The mean age at the time of injury was 52 ± 33.8 
years, and male patients comprised 86.4% (95% CI: 76.6%-94.4%). The mean number 
of spinal cord segments affected was 2.5 ± 4. Injury was most commonly inflicted 
by falls (58.4%, 95% CI: 46.6%-69.9%), followed by motor vehicle accidents 
(30.5%, 95% CI: 23.4%-38%). Preoperatively, abnormal magnetic resonance imaging 
findings were observed in 125 patients (31.4%), and included: Intervertebral 
disk injury in 33 patients (26.4%); Cord edema in 23 patients (18.4%); Cord 
contusion in 22 patients (17.6%); Ligamentous injury in 6 patients (4.8%); and 
MRI abnormalities not specified in 41 patients (32.8%). Postoperatively, 
neurological improvement was noted in 62% (95% CI: 21.4%-95.2%) of patients who 
underwent surgery within 72 hours after injury, and in 71.1% (95% CI: 33%-98.1%) 
of the patients who underwent surgery later than 72 hours after injury (P = .8).
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrated high rates of neurological 
improvement in patients treated surgically for cervical SCI without fracture and 
dislocation. No significant differences were noted between patients undergoing 
surgery acutely, within 72 hours after injury, and patients being treated 
surgically later in the course of cervical SCI without fracture and dislocation.

Intracranial artery stenosis (ICAS) is a significant contributor to ischemic 
stroke, with the RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys variant identified as a related genetic 
factor. We explored the clinical outcomes of the RNF213 genotype in patients 
with asymptomatic ICAS. Between November 2011 and March 2019, 139 patients with 
asymptomatic ICAS were enrolled in this study. Genotyping for RNF213 
p.Arg4810Lys was performed using Sanger sequencing. A comprehensive analysis was 
conducted to compare the RNF213 genotype with background characteristics and 
clinical outcomes such as ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular events and 
stenosis progression. RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys was found in 25% of cases, revealing 
distinct clinical features between carriers and non-carriers. The incidence of 
ipsilateral ischemic cerebrovascular events was 4.3% (6/139 cases), and stenosis 
progression was observed in 13% (18/139 cases) during a mean follow-up period of 
58 months. Stenosis progression rates were notably higher in the RNF213 variant 
group (25.7%; 9/35 cases) than in the RNF213 wild-type group (8.7%; 9/104 
cases). Cumulative stenosis progression rate was significantly higher in the 
RNF213 variant group than in the RNF213 wild-type group (log-rank test, 
P = 0.0004). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated a significant 
association between the RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys variant and an increased risk of 
stenosis progression (P = 0.03, odds ratio 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 
1.1-9.0). The RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys variant exhibits clinical disparities in 
asymptomatic ICAS and is notably linked to a heightened risk of stenosis 
progression. These results suggest a distinct difference in the vascular 
stenosis mechanism associated with this variant, warranting further 
investigation into its clinical implications and potential mechanistic insights.

The International Network of Special Immunization Services (INSIS) was 
established to investigate the causes and risk factors of rare adverse events 
following immunizations (AEFIs) and develop immunization strategies for 
mitigating or preventing risk for individuals with prior AEFIs or at risk of 
AEFIs. INSIS integrates clinical data with multi-omic technologies (e.g., 
transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) through a global consortium of 
clinical networks, leading immunology, pharmacogenomics teams to uncover the 
molecular mechanisms behind AEFIs. The network ensures accurate and standardized 
data collection and analysis through rigorous data management and quality 
assurance processes. INSIS also implements harmonized case definitions and 
protocols for collecting data and samples related to rare AEFIs, such as 
myocarditis, pericarditis, and Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombocytopenia and 
Thrombosis (VITT) after COVID-19 vaccinations. This protocol outlines the 
comprehensive approach to enhance risk-benefit assessments of vaccines across 
populations, identify actionable biomarkers to inform discovery and development 
of safe vaccines, and support personalized vaccination strategies.

PURPOSE: The pathogenicity of intragenic duplications depends on their 
structural configuration. Tandem duplications often disrupt reading frames and 
cause gene loss-of-function, whereas interspersed (non-tandem) duplications are 
largely benign. When the configuration cannot be determined, current guidelines 
presume a tandem structure, leading to some laboratories automatically 
classifying such variants as likely pathogenic or pathogenic. This study 
evaluates the validity of this presumption for DMD, in patients with and without 
clinical indications of dystrophinopathy.
METHODS: We performed high-coverage long-read genome sequencing on 15 patients 
with intragenic DMD duplications. Four patients had clinically indicated 
dystrophinopathy testing, while in the remaining 11 patients, the duplications 
were detected without clear indications of dystrophinopathy (e.g., through 
carrier screening).
RESULTS: All four patients with clinical indications had tandem duplications. In 
contrast, 64% (7/11) of the cases without such indications had interspersed 
duplications, with four subsequently re-classified as likely benign, two 
(likely) pathogenic, and one uncertain. These duplications were often complex, 
involving co-duplications or co-deletions with other regions.
CONCLUSION: Our findings challenge the presumption that intragenic DMD 
duplications are predominantly in tandem. This highlights the need for a 
cautious variant interpretation approach, particularly in carrier screening and 
other settings where variants are identified without indications of 
dystrophinopathy.

Background: Palliative care can help alleviate the suffering of a person as they 
face a serious life-threatening disease. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 
(ECMO) supports patients who have severe cardiac or respiratory failure; 
however, there is a mortality rate of roughly 50%. Despite this, the role of 
palliative care remains poorly characterized. Objectives: To characterize the 
use of palliative care among patients on venovenous ECMO (VV-ECMO). Design: A 
retrospective cohort study was performed and included patients supported by 
VV-ECMO at all four ECMO centers in Minnesota, USA. Variables associated with 
palliative care consultations (PCCs) were collected, stratified, and compared 
across protocols. Results: Of the 420 patients in this study, 230 patients 
(54.8%) received a PCC during their admission. Individuals who received a PCC 
were significantly less likely to survive to discharge (52.6%) compared to those 
who did not receive a PCC (72.6%; p value <0.001). Centers 1 and 2 had an 
automatic palliative consult included in the VV-ECMO electronic health record 
(EHR) order set, whereas Centers 3 and 4 did not. Center 1 had the highest PCC 
rate of 81.6%, followed by Center 2 with 49.4%. In comparison, Centers 3 and 4 
had significantly lower PCC rates of 36.9% and 29.7%, respectively (χ2 = 81.92, 
p value <0.0001). Conclusions: In this study we found a majority of patients on 
VV-ECMO received a PCC. However, the absence of her-embedded PCC was associated 
with a significantly reduced rate of PCCs.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reirradiation for recurrent or second primary head and 
neck cancer (HNC) can result in radiation-induced brachial plexopathy (RIBP), a 
debilitating side effect. This study aims to identify factors associated with 
the development of RIBP in patients undergoing reirradiation for recurrent or 
second primary HNC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 48 patients 
treated from 2015 to 2022 at a single National Cancer Institute-Designated 
Comprehensive Cancer Center, with a median follow-up duration of 22.7 months 
post-reirradiation. Patients underwent conventionally fractionated 
reirradiation, and a total of 72 brachial plexi that received overlapping 
courses of radiation were analyzed. Primary outcomes measured were the incidence 
of RIBP and factors contributing to increased risk, including EQD2 (equivalent 
dose in 2 Gy fractions) maximum point dose (Dmax, defined as 0.03 cc) and 
volumetric brachial plexus (BP) dosimetric endpoints (V80-V120), comorbidities, 
time between radiation courses, receipt of systemic therapy, and neck 
dissection. BP EQD2 was calculated using an alpha/beta of 3 Gy.
RESULTS: The crude incidence of RIBP was 23 %, occurring at a median of 
9.5 months after reirradiation, with 12- and 24-month rates of 11 % and 16 %, 
respectively. On univariate analysis, concurrent cisplatin during the second 
course of radiation (hazard ratio [HR] 9.04, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 
2.70-30.40, p < 0.001) and cumulative EQD2 BP Dmax ≥ 103 Gy2 (HR 1.10, CI: 
1.04-1.17, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with RIBP. These factors 
remained significant on multivariable analysis. RIBP incidence was significantly 
associated with all cumulative volumetric BP endpoints from V80-V120, with 
higher RIBP rates for V80 ≥ 1.94 cc, V100 ≥ 1.35 cc, V120 ≥ 0.89 cc, and EQD2 
Dmax ≥ 103 Gy2.
CONCLUSIONS: This study, the largest to date investigating rates of RIBP in 
patients with HNC treated with conventionally fractionated reirradiation, found 
that cumulative EQD2 maximum dose, and the use of concurrent cisplatin during 
the second RT course, were associated with increased rates of RIBP. 
Understanding these factors may guide clinicians in the setting of 
reirradiation, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes.

Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) accounts for around 25% of all lung 
cancers1,2 and has been associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke 
and air pollution in observational studies3-5. Here we use data from the 
Sherlock-Lung study to evaluate mutagenic exposures in LCINS by examining the 
cancer genomes of 871 treatment-naive individuals with lung cancer who had never 
smoked, from 28 geographical locations. KRAS mutations were 3.8 times more 
common in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from North America and Europe than in 
those from East Asia, whereas a higher prevalence of EGFR and TP53 mutations was 
observed in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from East Asia. Signature SBS40a, 
with unknown cause6, contributed the largest proportion of single base 
substitutions in adenocarcinomas, and was enriched in cases with EGFR mutations. 
Signature SBS22a, which is associated with exposure to aristolochic acid7,8, was 
observed almost exclusively in patients from Taiwan. Exposure to secondhand 
smoke was not associated with individual driver mutations or mutational 
signatures. By contrast, patients from regions with high levels of air pollution 
were more likely to have TP53 mutations and shorter telomeres. They also 
exhibited an increase in most types of mutations, including a 3.9-fold increase 
in signature SBS4, which has previously been linked with tobacco smoking9, and a 
76% increase in the clock-like10 signature SBS5. A positive dose-response effect 
was observed with air-pollution levels, correlating with both a decrease in 
telomere length and an increase in somatic mutations, mainly attributed to 
signatures SBS4 and SBS5. Our results elucidate the diversity of mutational 
processes shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never smokers.

INTRODUCTION: Both the prone transpsoas (PTP) single-position lateral lumbar 
interbody fusion (LLIF) and standard (dual-position) LLIF enable minimally 
invasive (MIS) indirect decompression and deformity correction. Existing studies 
comparing the utility of these approaches for adult spinal deformity (ASD) 
correction have been limited to small, single-center series. No study has 
investigated revision single-position PTP-LLIF versus standard LLIF in a large 
cohort of ASD patients.
METHODS: A multi-center cohort of all patients undergoing PTP-LLIF or standard 
LLIF revision for ASD between 2013 and 2021 were identified from 12 spine 
surgery centers. Standing 36″ scoliosis radiographs were retrospectively 
reviewed for assessment of spinopelvic parameters including pelvic incidence 
(PI), lumbar lordosis (LL), and PI-LL mismatch preoperatively and immediately 
postoperative. Multivariable analysis was performed to assess the primary 
outcome measure: postoperative change in regional sagittal alignment (PI-LL 
mismatch) between patients who had undergone revision surgery via PTP versus 
standard LLIF. Postoperative PI-LL mismatch correction was defined by PI-LL 
mismatch <10°.
RESULTS: Two-hundred and two patients were retrospectively identified and 
included for formal analysis. One-hundred and fifty-one (n = 151, 74.8 %) 
patients underwent PTP revision while 51 (25.2 %) underwent standard LLIF 
revision. Patients undergoing PTP had greater pre-operative PI-LL mismatch (21.4 
vs. 10.45°; p < 0.001). Complication rate (p = 0.029), length of stay (<0.001) 
and total follow up (p = 0.005) were decreased in the PTP patients when compared 
to standard LLIF, while fluoroscopy time (p = 0.036) and fluoroscopy dosage 
(p = 0.011) was increased. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that PTP was 
associated with increased change of having a postoperative PI-LL value <10° 
(p < 0.001), in addition to being associated with increased correction of PI-LL 
mismatch (p = 0.002) when controlling for multiple other variables.
CONCLUSION: Ultimately, PTP-LLIF was associated with greater net improvement in 
postoperative PI-LL mismatch, the primary outcome measure of this study. The 
present retrospective analysis expands upon previous studies demonstrating the 
potential superiority of PTP-LLIF versus conventional LLIF for sagittal plane 
correction in ASD revision surgery.

The study design is literature review. The sex-determining region Y gene 
(SRY)-related high mobility group box (HMG)-box (SOX) gene family has primarily 
been associated with neural development and sex determination and is a key 
component of human embryonic development. Recent studies on zebrafish models 
have demonstrated that the unique ability of the latter for central nervous 
tissue (CNS) repair following injury is largely mediated by SOX genes. Given 
that efforts aimed at the structural regeneration and functional restoration of 
neural tissue still represent a major therapeutic challenge in patients 
suffering CNS injury, these findings have initiated a discussion regarding the 
development of novel therapeutic strategies for SCI focusing on neural tissue 
regeneration. Spinal cord injury (SCI), in particular, represents a field that 
could greatly benefit from studies related to the function of the SOX genes. 
Neuro-informatics Laboratory, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. A literature review 
was conducted, with a focus on SOX gene that has been described in the 
experimental studies of SCI. In this review, the existing evidence linking the 
SOX gene family to the pathophysiology of SCI is summarized, and future research 
steps regarding the potential implications of the SOX genes in neurological 
recovery following SCI are discussed, especially focusing on highlighting 
potential therapeutic targets. The potential implications of the latter could 
play a crucial role in future efforts to advance the treatment approaches to 
SCI.

Ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel) and idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel), two 
BCMA-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies, have 
transformed outcomes for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM); however, 
the 6-8 weeks manufacturing time risks disease progression or death in up to 10% 
of patients, highlighting the need for effective bridging strategies. 
Talquetamab, a GPRC5D-targeting bispecific antibody, represents a promising 
option. We performed a multi-institutional retrospective analysis across 20 
centers (18 US, 2 Germany) evaluating talquetamab as a bridging therapy prior to 
cilta-cel or ide-cel. Among 134 patients receiving talquetamab, 119 proceeded to 
CAR-T (n=98 cilta-cel, n=21 ide-cel). Reasons for not proceeding (n=15) included 
progression (n=7), manufacturing failure (n=6), or patient decision (n=2). 
Median age was 65 years; patients had received a median 5 prior lines of 
therapy. High-risk cytogenetics and extramedullary disease were present in 44% 
and 41% respectively. Notably, 85% would not have met CARTITUDE-1/KarMMa 
eligibility criteria. Talquetamab was administered for a median 23 days (82% at 
0.8 mg/kg biweekly). Toxicity was manageable: no grade ≥3 CRS, 2% grade 3 ICANS 
and grade 1-2 Talq unique toxicities (70% oral, 38% skin, 17% nail; 60% 
resolved). Talquetamab achieved 71% response rate. Post CAR-T 88% responded (54% 
complete response), with low-grade toxicities (2 grade≥3 CRS, 1 grade 3 ICANS 
and 5% grade≥3 infections). Two cases of facial palsy and one AML occurred. 
Talquetamab correlated with sustained soluble BCMA decline and peak CAR-T 
expansion around day 14. Talquetamab bridging appears safe enabling the majority 
of difficult to treat patients to successfully proceed to BCMA CAR-T therapy.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, 
with its incidence rising due to aging populations, obesity, and advancements in 
diagnostic modalities. The interplay between sleep disorders and AF is 
increasingly recognized, with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) serving as a 
well-established risk factor. However, emerging evidence implicates additional 
sleep disturbances-including central sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs 
syndrome-in AF pathogenesis and progression. Despite compelling observational 
data, interventional studies evaluating the impact of sleep disorder treatment 
on AF outcomes have yielded mixed results. Although continuous positive airway 
pressure therapy in patients with OSA mitigates AF recurrence, randomized 
controlled trials have yet to confirm a definitive causal benefit. This review 
synthesizes epidemiological, mechanistic, and interventional data linking sleep 
disorders to AF.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic changes in kidney histology are often approximated by 
using human vision but with limited accuracy.
METHODS: An interactive annotation tool trained an artificial intelligence (AI) 
model for segmenting structures on whole slide images (WSIs) of kidney tissue. A 
total of 20,509 annotations trained the AI model with 20 classes of structures, 
including separate detection of cortex from medulla. We compared the AI model 
detections with human-based annotations in an independent validation set. The AI 
model was then applied to 1426 donors and 1699 patients with renal tumor to 
calculate chronic changes as defined by measures of nephron size (glomerular 
volume, cortex volume per glomerulus, and mean tubular areas) and 
nephrosclerosis (globally sclerotic glomeruli, increased interstitium, increased 
tubular atrophy (TA), arteriolar hyalinosis (AH), and artery luminal stenosis 
from intimal thickening). We then assessed whether chronic kidney disease (CKD) 
outcomes were associated with these chronic changes.
RESULTS: During the AI model validation step, the agreement between the AI 
detections and human annotations was similar to the agreement between human 
pairs, except that the AI model showed less agreement with AH. Chronic changes 
calculated solely from AI-based detections associated with low glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) during follow-up after kidney donation and with kidney 
failure after a radical nephrectomy for tumor. A chronicity score based on AI 
detections was calculated from cortex per glomerulus, percent 
glomerulosclerosis, TA foci density, and mean area of AH lesions and showed good 
prognostic discrimination for kidney failure (cross-validation C-statistic = 
0.819).
CONCLUSION: A multiclass AI model can help automate quantification of chronic 
changes on WSIs of kidney histology.

BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and 
sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have favorable 
cardiovascular outcomes compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) 
and sulfonylureas in adults with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk. 
How these benefits vary across lower levels of cardiovascular risk is unknown.
METHODS: We used nationwide claims data to emulate a comparative effectiveness 
trial and examine the heterogeneity of treatment effects of GLP-1RAs, SGLT2is, 
DPP4is, and sulfonylureas on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) among 
adults with type 2 diabetes and moderate cardiovascular risk (annualized MACE 
risk 1%-5%, estimated using the annualized claims-based MACE estimator).
RESULTS: Among 386 276 included adults with type 2 diabetes, 25.2% had baseline 
ACME-predicted MACE risk >1% to ≤2% (lower-risk patients) and 13.3% had 
ACME-predicted risk >4% to ≤5% (higher-risk patients). By year 3 of treatment, 
higher-risk patients derived greater absolute benefit than lower-risk patients 
when treated with GLP-1RAs versus sulfonylureas (absolute reduction in the 
estimated rate of MACE of 3.1% in higher-risk patients and 1.6% in lower-risk 
patients), SGLT2is versus sulfonylureas (absolute reduction, 3.9% in higher-risk 
patients and 1.3% in lower-risk patients), and GLP-1RAs versus DPP4is (absolute 
reduction, 1.6% in higher-risk patients and 0.5% in lower-risk patients). The 
relative benefits for MACE were also greater in higher-risk than lower-risk 
patients with SGLT2is versus DPP4is (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78 [95% CI, 0.70-0.87] 
in higher-risk patients; HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.88-1.12] in lower-risk patients). 
Conversely, the relative benefits of DPP4is and GLP-1RAs versus sulfonylureas 
were greater in lower-risk patients: HR 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81) in lower-risk 
and HR 0.91 (95% CI, 0.97-0.96) in higher-risk patients for DPP4is versus 
sulfonylureas; HR 0.67 (95% CI, 0.58-0.78) in lower-risk and HR 0.80 (95% CI, 
0.70-0.93) in higher-risk patients for GLP-1RAs versus sulfonylurea. Benefits of 
SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs were comparable across all risk levels.
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular benefits of SGLT2is and GLP-1RAs exist across all 
levels of moderate cardiovascular risk, reinforcing the importance of choosing 
glucose-lowering therapies that can prevent MACE in all people with type 2 
diabetes.

Machine-learning (ML) models have the potential to transform health care by 
enabling more personalized and data-driven clinical decision making. However, 
their successful implementation in clinical practice requires careful 
consideration of factors beyond predictive accuracy. We provide an overview of 
essential considerations for developing clinically applicable ML models, 
including methods for assessing and improving calibration, selecting appropriate 
decision thresholds, enhancing model explainability, identifying and mitigating 
bias, as well as methods for robust validation. We also discuss strategies for 
improving accessibility to ML models and performing real-world 
testing.HighlightsThis tutorial provides clinicians with a comprehensive guide 
to implementing machine-learning classification models in clinical practice.Key 
areas covered include model calibration, threshold selection, explainability, 
bias mitigation, validation, and real-world testing, all of which are essential 
for the clinical deployment of machine-learning models.Following these guidance 
can help clinicians bridge the gap between machine-learning model development 
and real-world application and enhance patient care outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The amount of walking that people with COPD do is reduced. However, 
data on their manner of walking (i.e. gait) are still lacking. We characterised 
real-world gait in COPD by assessing levels and distributions of gait 
parameters, and comparing them across COPD severity and with healthy peers.
METHODS: 549 people with COPD from seven European sites and 19 healthy older 
adults wore single wearable devices (either Axivity AX6 or DynaPort MoveMonitor 
MM+) continuously for 1 week, from which we identified walking bouts, calculated 
15 digital mobility outcomes (DMOs) aggregated at the weekly level, and compared 
them across COPD severity levels and with healthy peers.
RESULTS: Of the participants with COPD, 37% were female with a mean±sd age of 
68±8 years and a post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 54±20% 
predicted. All gait DMOs were normally distributed and exhibited variability 
between participants (e.g. mean±sd walking speed of 0.83±0.12 m·s-1, ranging 
from 0.48 to 1.20 m·s-1). Walking speed and cadence DMOs were lower with 
increasing disease severity (e.g. mean±sd walking speed of 0.88±0.11, 0.85±0.12, 
0.80±0.12 and 0.78±0.14 m·s-1 across Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive 
Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 1 to 4, p<0.001; mean±sd cadence of 93±6, 91±6 and 
89±7 steps·min-1 across GOLD A, B and E, p=0.013). Stride length and duration 
varied across COPD severity levels. Walking speed and cadence bout-to-bout 
variability only varied across dyspnoea severity levels. In a secondary 
analysis, we compared DMO data from people with COPD to a convenience sample of 
19 healthy older adults (47% women, mean age 71±6 years) and found that walking 
speed and cadence varied between participants with COPD and healthy adults (e.g. 
mean±sd walking speed 0.83±0.12 versus 0.90±0.12 m·s-1, p=0.041).
CONCLUSION: In people with COPD, gait DMOs are normally distributed and worsen 
as disease advances. Moreover, walking speed and cadence DMOs are significantly 
altered when compared to healthy peers. Further research should elucidate which 
DMOs can be improved with treatments to enhance mobility and reduce adverse 
events.

BACKGROUND: Pulsed field ablation (PFA) and high-power short-duration 
radiofrequency ablation (HPSD) are emerging techniques for treating atrial 
fibrillation (AF), offering promising results compared to cryoballoon ablation 
(CBA). This network meta-analysis aims to evaluates the efficacy and safety of 
PFA, HPSD, and CBA.
METHOD: PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were 
systematically searched for relevant studies until October 2024. The primary 
outcome is freedom from atrial arrhythmia. A random-effects model was used for 
data synthesis, and P-scores were employed for outcome ranking. Point estimation 
(odd ratios) was calculated for comparisons.
RESULTS: Eighteen studies were included in our network meta-analysis, involving 
7,071 atrial fibrillation patients. Among them, 2,023 (29%), 3,725 (53%), and 
1,323 (18%) patients underwent PFA, CBA, and HPSD, respectively. PFA 
demonstrated a higher freedom from atrial arrhythmia, with an odds ratio (OR) of 
3.63 (95% CI: 2.95-4.46) compared to CBA and 1.89 (95% CI: 1.47-2.43) compared 
to HPSD. However, PFA was associated with a higher risk of complications 
(OR = 6.54, 95% CI: 2.13-20.00) compared to CBA, while HPSD showed an 
insignificant association with a lower risk of complications compared to CBA 
(OR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.15-2.42). PFA had the shortest procedural time (P-score: 
100%), while HPSD had the longest (P-score: 0%). In contrast, HPSD had the 
shortest fluoroscopic time, with P-scores of 100%, 46%, and 3% for HPSD, PFA, 
and CBA, respectively.
CONCLUSION: PFA demonstrated higher efficacy but also a higher risk of 
complications compared to HPSD and CBA. HPSD showed greater efficacy with 
comparable safety to CBA.

BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in sentinel lymph 
nodes (SLNs) adversely affect prognosis, especially in low-risk endometrial 
cancer. In a retrospective study, we showed a worse recurrence-free survival for 
low-risk endometrial cancer with ITCs than the node-negative group.
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to evaluate whether the likelihood of disease 
recurrence differs between a prospective cohort of patients with low-risk 
endometrial cancer with ITCs and an historical cohort with negative SLNs.
STUDY HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that patients with low-risk endometrial cancer 
and ITCs will have a worse recurrence-free survival than patients who are 
node-negative.
TRIAL DESIGN: This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm observational 
study. Consecutive patients with low-risk endometrial cancer with ITCs in the 
SLNs will be accrued. Observation only will be suggested after surgery.
MAJOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: We will include patients with endometrial 
cancer undergoing pelvic SLN biopsy and ultra-staging with the following 
characteristics: endometrioid histology, grades 1 to 2, <50% myometrial 
invasion, without substantial/extensive lympho-vascular space invasion. ITCs in 
SLNs are defined as tumor cell aggregates ≤0.2 mm or <200 cells.
PRIMARY END POINT: The primary end point is recurrence-free survival, measured 
from the date of surgery to the date of recurrence, death, or last disease 
evaluation.
SAMPLE SIZE: With a sample size of 132 women with low-risk endometrial cancer 
and ITCs, a 1-sided log-rank test achieves 85% power at a 0.05 significance 
level to detect an HR of 2.1. The expected number of events during the study is 
17.3.
ESTIMATED DATES FOR COMPLETING ACCRUAL AND PRESENTING RESULTS: The study 
duration will be 60 months: 24 for enrollment and 36 for follow-up. The results 
are expected in 2029.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06689956.

The microvasculature of peripheral nerve not only is important for the 
understanding of the development of compression syndromes, but it plays a 
critical role in the evolution of other nerve pathologies, including, for 
example, the distribution of intraneural ganglion cysts and lymphoma. We 
investigated the anatomical course of vessels around the human sciatic nerve and 
its bifurcation in eight human cadavers. Specifically, the presence of 
fenestrations on the epineurium and paraneurium's thickness in relation to the 
intraneural vessels was investigated. The sciatic, tibial, peroneal and sural 
nerves at the level of the bifurcation are surrounded by different layers, 
including the epineurium and paraneurial layers. Multiple fenestrations were 
observed in all membranes surrounding these nerves, which formed openings for 
the transfer of adipocytes and vessels from one compartment to the neighboring 
one. The openings were relatively large compared to the size of the vessels. In 
conclusion, vessels always travel through a natural opening in the paraneurial 
and epineurium. These vessels are important connections between the extrinsic 
and intrinsic nerve vasculature. In addition, the fenestration provides an 
important anatomical explanation for the possibility of transfer of anesthetic 
agents or different nerve pathologies, including intraneural ganglion cyst and 
tumors.

BACKGROUND: Thresholds to define prognosis with hs-cTnI (high-sensitivity 
cardiac troponin I) have not been systematically addressed in wild-type 
transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, in part because of the multiplicity of 
hs-cTnI assays. The aims of this study were: first, to assess the prognostic 
performance of hs-cTnI measured with different assays in patients with wild-type 
transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy and, second, to identify assay-specific 
hs-cTnI thresholds for prognosis that could be integrated into staging systems 
for risk stratification.
METHODS: Observational multicenter study of stable wild-type transthyretin 
amyloid cardiomyopathy patients from different cohorts using the Abbott 
Architect Stat hs-cTnI assay and the Beckman Coulter Access hs-cTnI assay 
(testing cohorts) and the Siemens Centaur XPT hs-cTnI assay (validation cohort). 
Outcome was all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: In the Abbott cohort (n=136; median follow-up 22 [13-41] months; 31 
[23%] deaths) and Beckman cohort (n=98; median follow-up 19 [12-28] months; 16 
[16%] deaths), natural log-transformed hs-cTnI was an independent predictor of 
mortality (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.11-2.35]; P=0.012 
and 2.47 [95% CI, 1.48-4.14]; P<0.001, respectively). The best hs-cTnI threshold 
for 18-month mortality of the combined Abbott/Beckman cohorts (n=234) was 81 
ng/L, rounded to 80 ng/L for simplicity of clinical use. A 2-variable staging 
system (based on the Mayo Clinic system) using hs-cTnI (>80 ng/L) and NPs 
(natriuretic peptides; NT-proBNP [N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide] 
>3000 ng/L or BNP [B-type natriuretic peptide] >250 ng/L) identified 3 groups 
with progressively worse prognosis. The staging system (using hs-cTnI >80 ng/L 
and NT-proBNP>3000 ng/L) was then applied to an independent cohort evaluated 
with the hs-cTnI Siemens assay (n=345, median follow-up 32 [24-42] months, 119 
[34%] deaths). The significant differences between the groups were maintained.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with wild-type transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, 
hs-cTnI is a strong and independent predictor of mortality. A threshold of 
hs-cTnI of 80 ng/L for these 3 assays provides effective risk stratification 
alone and in a staging system with NP.

The link between regional tau load and clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) highlights the importance of characterizing spatial tau 
distribution across disease variants. In typical (memory-predominant) AD, the 
spatial progression of tau pathology mirrors the functional connections from 
temporal lobe epicenters. However, given the limited spatial heterogeneity of 
tau in typical AD, atypical (non-amnestic-predominant) AD variants with distinct 
tau patterns provide a key opportunity to investigate the universality of 
connectivity as a scaffold for tau progression. In this large-scale, multicenter 
study across 14 international sites, we included cross-sectional tau-PET data 
from 320 individuals with atypical AD (n=139 posterior cortical atrophy/PCA-AD; 
n=103 logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia/lvPPA-AD; n=35 behavioural 
variant AD/bvAD; n=43 corticobasal syndrome/CBS-AD), with a subset of 
individuals (n=78) having longitudinal tau-PET data. Additionally, as an 
independent sample, we included regional post-mortem tau stainings from 93 
atypical AD patients from two sites (n=19 PCA-AD, n=32 lvPPA-AD, n=23 bvAD, n=19 
CBS-AD). Gaussian mixture modeling was used to harmonize different tau-PET 
tracers by transforming tau-PET standardized uptake value ratios to tau 
positivity probabilities (a uniform scale ranging from 0% to 100%). Using linear 
regression, we assessed whether brain regions with stronger resting-state 
fMRI-based functional connectivity, derived from healthy elderly controls in the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), showed greater covariance in 
cross-sectional and longitudinal tau-PET and post-mortem tau pathology. 
Furthermore, we examined whether functional connectivity of tau-PET epicenters 
(i.e., the top 5% of regions with the highest baseline tau load) and tau-PET 
accumulation epicenters (i.e., the top 5% of regions with the highest tau 
accumulation rates) was associated with cross-sectional and longitudinal tau 
patterns. Our findings show that tau-PET epicenters aligned with clinical 
variants, e.g. a visual network predominant pattern in PCA-AD ('visual AD') and 
left-hemispheric temporal predominance, particularly within the language 
network, in lvPPA-AD ('language AD'). Moreover, more strongly functionally 
connected regions showed correlated concurrent tau-PET levels (confirmed with 
post-mortem data) and tau-PET accumulation rates. The functional connectivity 
profile of tau-PET epicenters and accumulation epicenters corresponded to 
tau-PET progression patterns, with higher tau-PET levels and accumulation rates 
in functionally close regions, and lower tau-PET levels and accumulation rates 
in functionally distant regions. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis 
that tau propagation occurs along functional connections originating from local 
epicenters, across all AD clinical variants. Since tau proteinopathy is a major 
driver of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, this finding may advance 
personalized medicine and participant-specific endpoints in clinical trials.

We report demographics and post-lensectomy outcomes in 30 children (39 eyes) 
with Down syndrome and cataract. Mean age at first lensectomy was 3.0 years 
(range, 0.04-12.9); 16 of 30 patients (53%) had lensectomy before 12 months of 
age. The 5-year cumulative incidence of glaucoma-related adverse events was 38% 
(95% CI, 0%-69%); of retinal detachment, 3% (95% CI, 0%-9%). The median myopic 
shift in children with refractive data at 5 years was -10.00 D (IQR, -12.50 to 
-8.38 D) in 11 aphakic eyes and -1.50 D (IQR, -3.00 D to -0.25 D) in 7 
pseudophakic eyes. The period prevalence (combining cases at baseline with those 
developing the condition during follow up) of strabismus by 5 years was 81% (95% 
CI, 40%-94%), and of nystagmus, 68% (95% CI, 41%-83%). In 11 children able to 
perform optotype testing, 2 of 12 study eyes (17% [95% CI, 3%-56%]) had visual 
acuity of 20/60 or better at 5 years.

BACKGROUND: Plantar vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare cause of unilateral plantar 
foot pain not commonly assessed during sonographic scans for venous 
thromboembolic evaluation. The present study aims to increase awareness of PVT 
when evaluating musculoskeletal conditions and to discuss the utility and 
characteristic imaging findings of PVT on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review identifying patients with 
suspected PVT via search of a single institution's radiology reports. Twelve 
patients had an available lower extremity MRI. These 12 MRIs were independently 
reviewed by 2 fellowship-trained musculoskeletal radiologists for common imaging 
characteristics. Of note, only 7 of the 12 available imaging studies contained 
MRI findings consistent with PVT as determined by the radiology reviewers. For 
these 7 patients, clinical characteristics were also recorded.
RESULTS: Between both radiology reviewers, there was 100% agreement confirming, 
localizing, and describing the findings of PVT. Of the 7 cases of MRI-confirmed 
PVT, 6 of 7 studies were performed without contrast and 1 of 7 was performed 
with and without contrast. The lateral plantar vein was the predominant vein 
involved in 85.7% (6/7). All 7 cases showed signs of intraluminal signal change, 
venous enlargement, and muscle edema. Two cases (28.6%, 2/7) displayed 
collateralization and/or enlargement of surrounding veins. In the only MRI 
performed with contrast, perivascular enhancement and a filling defect were 
noted.
CONCLUSION: In the evaluation of a painful foot, an MRI can be used to diagnose 
PVT reliably and may have several advantages over compression ultrasonography 
(US) because of its ability to identify other unsuspected etiologies of a 
painful foot and elimination of technical limitations of compression US in the 
plantar foot region.

BACKGROUND: Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia is characterized by destruction of 
red blood cells mediated by autoantibodies, which can be triggered by various 
underlying factors including tick-borne infections. Babesia spp. are protozoan 
parasites transmitted by tick bites that cause babesiosis and have been 
increasingly recognized as a potential precipitating factor for warm autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia.
CASE PRESENTATION: This was a retrospective review of a single case where 
patient information was extracted from the electronic medical records after 
written informed consent was obtained. A literature review was also performed. 
We present a rare case of a 71-year-old White, non-Hispanic/Latino male patient 
with babesiosis and concurrent warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The patient 
initially presented with fever, chills, and anemia. A tick-borne illness panel 
was positive for Babesia microti. Despite therapy with doxycycline, 
azithromycin, and atovaquone, the hemoglobin continued to decline. This prompted 
investigation for autoimmune hemolytic anemia. A direct antiglobulin test 
revealed weak positivity for immunoglobulin G. After treatment with high-dose 
prednisone, the patient's hemoglobin gradually improved, and his liver enzymes 
normalized.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing prevalence of tick-borne illnesses, physicians 
should have a high index of suspicion for concurrent warm autoimmune hemolytic 
anemia in patients with babesiosis and anemia not improving with typical 
therapies. In addition, the interplay between babesiosis and warm autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia underscores the need for clinicians to consider infectious 
etiologies in the workup of this disease.

ZUMA-8 evaluated the safety of brexucabtagene autoleucel (brexu-cel), a 
CD19-directed autologous chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapy, 
for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (R/R CLL). 
Patients with ≥2 prior lines of therapy (including a Bruton tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor) underwent leukapheresis, optional bridging therapy, and conditioning 
chemotherapy (fludarabine/cyclophosphamide) before infusion of 1 × 106 (cohort 
1) or 2 × 106 (cohort 2) anti-CD19 CAR T cells per kg. Patients in cohort 3 (low 
tumor burden), and cohort 4A (postibrutinib) received 1 × 106 cells per kg. 
Fifteen patients, median age of 63 years (range, 52-79), were treated in cohorts 
1 (n = 6), 2 (n = 3), 3 (n = 3), and 4A (n = 3). Median follow-up was 24.3 
months. One dose-limiting toxicity was observed in cohort 3 (grade 4 cytokine 
release syndrome). Grade ≥3 neurologic events occurred in 3 patients (20%). 
Seven of 15 patients responded (overall response rate, 47%; complete response 
[CR], 7%), including all 3 patients in cohort 3 (1 with CR). CAR T-cell 
expansion occurred in 4 patients (27%), with an apparent weak inverse 
correlation with absolute lymphocyte count before apheresis. Brexu-cel had no 
new safety signals in R/R CLL. CAR T-cell expansion and responses occurred in 
patients with low tumor burden. This trial was registered at 
www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03624036.

Goal of this study was to examine the impact of immunotherapy on overall 
survival (OS) in patients with female genital tract melanoma (GTM). This 
retrospective cohort study utilized the National Cancer Database to identify 
individuals with invasive vulvar or vaginal melanoma diagnosed between 2004 and 
2019. Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariate Cox regression were used to describe 
the impact of immunotherapy on OS and to examine predictors of OS among those 
who received immunotherapy for those with vulvar or vaginal melanoma. Of the 870 
patients with vaginal melanoma, 23.6% received immunotherapy. Receiving 
immunotherapy for treatment of vaginal melanoma was associated with improved OS 
(median: 21.8 versus 18.9 months; P  = 0.01); this association remained after 
adjustment for other prognostic factors [hazard ratio (HR), 0.77; 95% confidence 
interval (CI), 0.62-0.95; P  = 0.01]. The survival advantage was more pronounced 
among those who did not receive primary surgical resection (median: 18.6 versus 
12.2 months; P  = 0.0009). Among 3123 patients with vulvar melanoma, 15.3% 
received immunotherapy. Receiving immunotherapy for treatment of vulvar melanoma 
was associated with an improvement in OS (median: 43.6 versus 57.7 months; P 
 = 0.06; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-1.00; P  = 0.04). Survival benefit was more 
pronounced when restricted to patients with advanced or unknown stage disease 
(median OS, 31.6 versus 24.2 months; P  = 0.002; adjusted HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 
0.61-0.89; P  = 0.002) and among the small subset who did not receive primary 
surgical resection (median: 19.8 versus 9.6 months; P  = 0.0005). Immunotherapy 
was associated with improved OS in patients with female GTM, with some subsets 
particularly benefitting.

PURPOSE: To assess whether causes of moral distress vary by academic 
institution. Moral distress is experienced when health care providers are unable 
to provide the right care to patients because of institutional or resource 
constraints.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was performed based on Moral Distress 
Scale-Revised for Health Care Professionals for 16 clinical scenarios assessing 
frequency and severity of moral distress among academic radiologists. The survey 
was sent to members of the RSNA Quality Improvement Committee for distribution 
to their department. Measure of Moral Distress for Health Care Professionals 
(MMD-HP) was calculated for individuals and moral distress index for clinical 
scenarios. MMD-HP were compared by sex, ethnicity, age, years of practice, 
weekly work hours, practice setting or type, and consideration of leaving the 
workplace. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test and 
Kendall ordinal correlation.
RESULTS: In all, 126 respondents from five institutions from five different 
states were included in the analysis. MMD-HP ranged from 24 to 66 (maximum 266). 
Median MMD-HP was higher in radiologists working >60 hours per week (59 versus 
32.5, P = .048). Radiologists across institutions consistently reported four 
main sources of moral distress: pressure to perform unsafe numbers of studies 
(108 of 126, 85%), high workloads impeding resident teaching (102 of 126, 81%), 
lack of administrative support for patient care issues (102 of 126, 81%), and 
pressure to conduct unnecessary imaging (111 of 126, 88%). Higher MMD-HPs 
correlated significantly with job turnover intentions or past job changes (P < 
.001). The average percentage of radiologists with an intention to leave or 
having left as position was 44% with a range of 26% to 84%.
CONCLUSION: Moral distress is pervasive in radiology, with four primary causes 
consistently identified across academic institutions. Strong association between 
higher moral distress levels and job turnover intentions highlights its impact 
on workforce retention.

Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a frequent sleep-related sensorimotor disorder 
defined by an urge to move the legs in the evening while resting. Severe RLS 
symptoms can negatively impact sleep, mood, and quality of life. Periodic leg 
movements during sleep and wakefulness are found in 60% to 80% of patients with 
RLS. The pathophysiology of RLS and periodic leg movement is still poorly 
understood and involves brain iron deficiency, dopamine dysregulation, and 
genetic predisposition. Over the past decades, several cross-sectional and 
longitudinal studies have reported an association between RLS, cardiovascular 
disease, and hypertension although the magnitude, direction, and underlying 
mechanisms of these associations remain inconclusive. Periodic leg movements 
during sleep are concomitant with an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, 
which may affect the physiological nocturnal blood pressure dip and, therefore, 
lead to an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. Insomnia and sleep 
deprivation linked to sensory discomfort could also increase the sympathetic 
tone and contribute to an increase in cardiovascular risk. Comorbidities and 
associated sleep disorders may also synergically increase cardiovascular risk. 
This narrative review details the current knowledge of RLS, a still 
underdiagnosed and poorly recognized disorder, and examines the epidemiological 
relationship between RLS, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, potential 
mechanisms underlying this association, and strategies to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular disease in patients with moderate-to-severe RLS. Greater 
multidisciplinary collaborations between cardiologists and sleep specialists are 
needed to better identify, understand, and manage patients with sleep disorders, 
including those with RLS.

BACKGROUND: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) 
affects over one third of the global population and is closely linked to 
gastrointestinal, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. As the most common 
cause of steatotic liver disease (SLD), MASLD is often referred to as "fatty 
liver" in general health information searches. With the Internet becoming a 
primary source of healthcare information, this study aimed to evaluate global 
and regional public interest in steatotic liver disease using Google Trends data 
from January 2004 to December 2024.
METHODS: A comprehensive analysis was performed using Google Trends with the 
search term "fatty liver disease." Interest levels were quantified using Google 
Trends indices, and temporal patterns were evaluated using average annual 
percent change (AAPC). Regional variations were assessed to identify geographic 
hotspots of public interest.
RESULTS: Global interest in MASLD demonstrated significant growth (AAPC: 6.77%, 
95% Confidence interval [CI]: 5.33-8.23), with a 264% increase from 2004 to 
2024. Peak interest was observed in August 2024 (index: 100) compared to the 
lowest point in June 2007. Iran showed the highest country-specific search 
volume (index: 100), while within the United States, West Virginia demonstrated 
the greatest relative interest (index: 100). Key topics associated with MASLD 
included "liver," "symptoms," "disease," and "therapy."
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial growth in global public interest in MASLD, with 
distinct temporal and geographical patterns, provides insights to develop 
targeted awareness campaigns and educational interventions, particularly in 
regions with low search volumes. Future research should examine the relationship 
between online search patterns and clinical outcomes in MASLD.

OBJECTIVE: There are few real-world comparisons of transcatheter edge-to-edge 
repair (TEER) and mitral valve (MV) surgery in older patients. We investigated 
the short- and long-term outcomes of surgical and transcatheter interventions 
for treating mitral regurgitation (MR) in patients aged 80 years or older.
METHODS: From 2014 to 2024, 744 patients aged 80 years or older underwent MV 
surgery (N=390) or TEER (N=354) at our institution. Four hundred sixty-six 
patients without additional procedures or MV stenosis met inclusion criteria; 
1:1 propensity score matching was then applied, yielding a final matched cohort 
of 252 patients.
RESULTS: After matching, baseline characteristics were comparable; the median 
age was 83.5 years (IQR: 81.7-85.9), and 78.2% had degenerative MR. Thirty-day 
mortality was similar between surgery (1.6%) and TEER (0.8%) (P = 0.561). 
Postoperatively, surgical patients had higher rates of atrial fibrillation, 
prolonged mechanical ventilation, and longer ICU and hospital stays (P < 0.001). 
Predischarge echocardiography showed less residual MR (2.4% vs. 8%, P < 0.001), 
less tricuspid regurgitation (10.5% vs. 50%, P < 0.001), and lower RV systolic 
pressure (37.5 vs. 44 mmHg, P < 0.001) after surgery. Over a median 3.9-year 
follow-up, recurrent MR remained lower (6.4% vs. 33.3%, P < 0.001), and 
five-year survival was superior following surgery (68% vs. 56%, P = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: Both surgical correction of MR and TEER can be performed relatively 
safely in octogenarians. While TEER is associated with shorter hospital stays 
and fewer procedure-related complications, MV surgery results in less recurrent 
MR and better late survival.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Familial cavernous malformations (FCMs) are vascular 
lesions that pose a lifelong risk of symptomatic hemorrhage (SH) and seizures, 
yet their natural history remains unclear. This study aims to determine the 
cumulative lifetime risk of a first SH and/or seizure and assess whether genetic 
variations influence these risks.
METHODS: This international, multicenter retrospective cohort study included 
data from 16 tertiary referral centers and 1 patient advocacy group. Eligible 
patients had confirmed or suspected FCM, available magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) data, documented baseline clinical features, and longitudinal follow-up 
(FU). Functional outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 
last FU. Direct adjusted survival curves and mixed-effects Cox regression 
analyses were performed to estimate cumulative lifetime risk. The association 
between genetic variations and SH/seizure rates was evaluated, and mixed-effects 
logistic regression assessed the effect of SH/seizures on mRS outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 1,592 patients with FCM were included, with a mean age of 
37.6 years (SD 17.1) and 55.7% female. The median FU was 42 years (IQR: 27-55), 
totaling 64,146 person-years. Of these, 869 (54.6%) had confirmed FCM, 775 
(48.7%) experienced at least 1 hemorrhage, and 447 (28.1%) had at least 1 
seizure. Genetic testing was performed in 47.7%, identifying CCM1 (31.0%), CCM2 
(4.8%), and CCM3 (1.9%) variations. The lifetime risk of a first SH was ∼80%, 
with an event rate that remained constant beyond age 20. The lifetime risk of a 
first seizure was ∼45%. Patients with CCM3 variations exhibited a more 
aggressive hemorrhagic course than those with CCM1 (hazard ratio 1.799, 95% CI 
1.008-3.208). SH and seizures were independently associated with worse mRS 
outcomes at last FU.
DISCUSSION: The event rate of SH and seizures remained stable over time, leading 
to high cumulative lifetime risks. Patients with CCM3 variations exhibited a 
more aggressive disease course. Limitations include the non-population-based 
design, selection bias from tertiary centers, retrospective data collection, and 
variability in data extraction across centers. However, this study represents 
the largest international FCM cohort to date, improving the precision of risk 
estimates and providing valuable insights into disease progression.

BACKGROUND: Yao syndrome (YAOS) is a NOD2-associated autoinflammatory disease 
characterized by periodic fevers, dermatitis, polyarthritis, swelling of the 
distal extremities, and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with specific NOD2 
variants. While gastrointestinal symptoms are a hallmark of the disease, little 
is known about specific symptoms and their underlying mechanisms.
METHODS: In this study, we identified 24 patients with YAOS from an 
institutional YAOS databse. We evaluated their presenting gastrointestinal 
symptoms at initial presentation via the validated Gastrointestinal Symptom 
Rating Scale questionnaire, which 14 participants filled out. We then 
systematically analyzed all gastrointestinal-relevant blood work, stool studies, 
imaging, endoscopies, and motility testing.
RESULTS: Gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by 100% of patients, with the 
most prominent symptom being bloating. Most of the workup including stool 
testing, gastrointestinal-related bloodwork, and endoscopic examinations with 
biopsies was normal. Abdominopelvic radiographs and cross-sectional imaging 
studies were most often normal, although an excessive stool burden was commonly 
identified. A minority of patients had associated diagnoses of collagenous 
gastritis, celiac disease, autoimmune-like enteropathy, or microscopic colitis. 
Gastric and colonic motility testing was normal in most patients; however, 
anorectal manometry with balloon expulsion testing was abnormal in 100% of 
tested patients. A minority of patients had hepatic steatosis or benign liver 
lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Gastrointestinal symptoms of YAOS are universal and severe, and 
symptoms may arise from both inflammatory and non-inflammatory mechanisms. 
Bloating and constipation may be driven by dyssynergic defecation.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate intraoperative and postoperative outcomes following 
primary inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) implantation among patients with or 
without prior history of pelvic radiation therapy (RT).
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective analysis of men undergoing 
primary IPP placement between July 2016 and July 2021. Among 3,530 patients, 211 
had a history of RT. After 1:1 propensity score matching for all confounding 
variables, we compared intraoperative and postoperative outcomes between 
irradiated and non-irradiated cohorts. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests were 
used for statistical analysis for categorical and continuous variables 
respectively. For multivariable analysis, we used a multivariate logistic 
regression model. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate postoperative 
complication-free survival.
RESULTS: Patients with prior RT had higher intraoperative complication rates 
(4.3% vs 0.9%, p=0.032), particularly distal crossover events (1.9% vs 0%, 
p=0.044). On multivariable analysis, history of prior RT in the setting of 
radical prostatectomy (OR 5.95, 95% CI 1.17-30.3, p=0.032) and history of 
diabetes mellitus (OR 9.09, 95% CI 2.29-37.0, p=0.002) were associated with 
increased odds of intraoperative complications. Conversely, obesity was 
associated with reduced odds (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.82, p=0.032). No 
significant differences were observed in postoperative complications or 
reoperation rates over 24 months.
CONCLUSION: Prior RT is associated with an increased rate of intraoperative IPP 
complications. Postoperative complication and reoperation rates were similar to 
control cases.

Ewing sarcoma (EwS) is an aggressive cancer diagnosed in adolescents and young 
adults. Inhibition of TGFβ is being tested in limited clinical trials for 
relapsed EwS. TGFβ is an immunosuppressive cytokine that exists in latent and 
active states. The functional impact of TGFβ inhibition on the Ewing tumor 
microenvironment (TME) and on Ewing tumor behavior remains largely unknown. 
Here, we use single-cell RNAseq analysis of human Ewing tumors to demonstrate 
that immune cells are the largest contributors of TGFB1 expression in the human 
Ewing TME. We utilize a humanized mouse model of EwS to demonstrate that TME 
signatures in these models differ significantly from EwS tumors developed in 
immunodeficient mice. Using this humanized model, we investigate the effect of 
TGFβ inhibition on the EwS TME during radiation therapy, a treatment that is 
commonly used to treat unresectable, metastatic, and relapsed/refractory EwS 
that is known to enhance TGFβ activation in multiple cancers. Utilizing a 
trivalent ligand TGFβ trap to inhibit TGF, we demonstrate that in combination 
with radiation therapy, TGFβ inhibition both increases EwS immune cell 
infiltration and decreases lung metastatic burden in vivo. These data 
demonstrate the value of immunocompetent models to address immune-biologic 
preclinical questions in EwS and demonstrate that TGFβ inhibition during 
radiation therapy is a promising strategy to enhance anti-tumor immune response 
and improve treatment efficacy for metastatic EwS.

The physiological function of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 2 
(BACE2) in vascular endothelium of systemic arteries is unknown. In the present 
study, we generated conditional tamoxifen-inducible endothelial BACE2-deficient 
mice (eBACE2-/- mice). Electron microscopic and Western blot analyses revealed 
that BACE2 protein is mainly present in endothelial cells of aorta. Genetic 
deletion of BACE2 in endothelial cells significantly impaired 
endothelium-dependent relaxations to Ca2+-ionophore A23187 in eBACE2-/- aortas 
as compared with tamoxifen-treated control mice, irrespective of sex. Blockade 
of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) with Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester abolished 
relaxations to A23187. In contrast, endothelium-independent relaxations to 
nitric oxide donor diethylamine-NONOate were unchanged. Expression of 
endothelial NOS protein and levels of cyclic nucleotides were also unaffected in 
eBACE2-/- mice. Further analysis of the mechanisms underlying impaired 
endothelial function demonstrated that treatment with thromboxane A2 receptor 
antagonist SQ29548 ameliorated relaxations to A23187 in the aorta of male and 
female eBACE2-/- mice. Furthermore, mRNA and protein expressions of 
cyclooxygenase-2 as well as production of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin F2α 
were significantly increased in the aorta of eBACE2-/- mice. In contrast, 
production of 6-keto prostaglandin F1α and prostaglandin E2 was not affected. In 
addition, ex vivo treatment of wild-type aortas with proinflammatory cytokines 
decreased protein expression of BACE2. The results of our study suggest that 
increased production of vasoconstrictor prostanoids is responsible for 
impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxations to A23187 in the aorta of 
eBACE2-/- mice. We report a previously unrecognized role of BACE2 in the control 
of endothelial arachidonic acid metabolism and vasomotor function.NEW & 
NOTEWORTHY The exact physiological role of BACE2 in endothelial function of 
systemic arteries is unknown. Our study shows that thromboxane A2 and 
prostaglandin F2α are responsible for impairment of endothelium-dependent 
relaxations in endothelium-specific BACE2-deficient mice. The data support an 
important role of BACE2 in the control of endothelial arachidonic acid 
metabolism and vasomotor function.

Academic surgeons face an often overwhelming load of daily responsibilities. 
Frequently, the teaching and assessing of residents can receive little attention 
given the press of clinical and administrative duties. While an array of 
incentives have been developed to increase faculty compliance in education, we 
argue that there is one fundamental fact concerning the education of a trainee 
that is often overlooked: education is an ethical obligation. Offering accurate, 
critical, and helpful feedback to trainees fulfills an ethical obligation 
surgeons have towards future patients.

New technologies enabling access to high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) 
assays at the point of care (POC) are available for routine use. POC technology 
can accelerate cardiac troponin testing within the hospital setting and support 
testing in other healthcare environments. Pre-analytical and analytical issues 
unique to POC testing are discussed. The opportunities and the evidence needed 
to support the routine use of hs-cTn POC assays in clinical care are outlined. 
Based on recent developments, the potential impact of hs-cTn at the POC in 
multiple clinical settings is described, and a roadmap of the steps required for 
successful implementation is provided.

Antimicrobials are used in the final few months of life in an attempt to 
palliate symptoms or treat potentially reversible infections. Antimicrobials 
cause side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, rash, and allergic reactions. 
Clinicians should select the narrowest and shortest treatment duration 
appropriate to the infection. Here, we present common oral antimicrobial agents 
used at the end of life, highlighting microbial coverage and important 
prescribing considerations. Providers should be aware of the limitations of 
antimicrobial treatment for patients at the end of life, particularly those 
enrolled in hospice, to inform discussions with patients and their families. 
This will allow tailoring of treatment to the patient's clinical situation and 
wishes.

BackgroundAntibiotics are frequently prescribed at the end of life, though the 
benefits and harms are not well understood.MethodsWe abstracted relevant 
findings from articles published in English in the past 25 years to answer 
questions generated by discussion among the authors and with stakeholders in 
Palliative Care and Infectious Diseases.FindingsPrescribing practices vary based 
on individual situation and geographic location. Patients with cancer and those 
hospitalized receive more antibiotics than those enrolled in outpatient hospice. 
Urinary tract infections and pulmonary infections are the most common conditions 
treated with antibiotics at the end of life -most often with penicillin 
derivatives and vancomycin in the hospital, fluoroquinolones in outpatient, and 
cephalosporins in both settings. When asked, patients most often prefer limiting 
antibiotics to symptom management at the end of life. Physicians' 
over-estimation of patient preference for antibiotics and the increased 
probability of misdiagnosis increases antibiotic prescription rates. Antibiotics 
can improve symptoms when used for specific diseases at the cost of drug 
reactions, resistant organisms, and delayed discharge. Antibiotic use has 
variable results on survival duration. Antimicrobial stewardship exists in 
hospital and long-term care facilities, but not outpatient hospice groups. 
Stewardship interventions could increase proper use of antibiotics, but more 
information is needed to apply these interventions to hospice 
groups.ConclusionsAntibiotics at the end of life are impactful and efforts to 
educate patients and providers will be invaluable in optimizing care.

Left ventricular recovery (LV) in patients with advanced heart failure (HF) 
supported by a durable left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is uncommon but 
clinically significant. There is limited understanding on the timing of LV 
recovery in relation to LVAD implantation. A total of 383 HF patients who 
underwent LVAD implantation were evaluated for LV functional improvement defined 
as an absolute increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of greater 
than or equal to 20% post-LVAD placement. Out of 383 LVAD patients, 39 (10.1%) 
demonstrated significant LV improvement. Among these, 25 (64%) patients had 
received LVAD less than or equal to 1 year of HF diagnosis, whereas 14 (36%) 
patients were implanted greater than 1 year from HF diagnosis. No significant 
differences in baseline imaging or hemodynamics were found between these two 
groups. The timing of LVAD implantation and time from LVAD to LVEF improvement 
was not associated with 5 year outcomes. Survival, free from HF relapse or 
transplant was 59% in the less than or equal to 1 year and 46% in greater than 1 
year HF duration groups (p = 0.83). Thus, LV functional improvement can occur 
across a broad spectrum of HF duration, suggesting that the potential for 
recovery is not limited to those with newly diagnosed disease.

BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) sensitization is a significant barrier 
to transplantation for many patients. Daratumumab has proven safety and 
tolerability in multiple myeloma. We hypothesized that daratumumab monotherapy 
could be an effective and safe desensitization strategy in highly sensitized 
patients awaiting cardiac transplantation.
OBJECTIVES: The primary end-point of this trial was the scope of daratumumab in 
lowering HLA antibodies. Secondary end-points included presence of 
donor-specific antibody, incidence of cellular and antibody-mediated 
rejection (AMR) and cardiac allograft function.
METHODS: Six consecutive highly sensitized patients were enrolled who had a 
calculated panel reactive antibody >50% using a mean fluorescence intensity 
(MFI) threshold >4,000 through a single antigen bead assay. Three completed the 
full 8 weeks of daratumumab therapy. HLA antibodies with MFI >10,000 were 
considered unacceptable for donor offers. All patients received weekly doses of 
1,800 mg daratumumab and 30,000 units hyaluronidase subcutaneously for a planned 
total of 8 weeks.
RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in HLA class I and class II 
antibodies by the time of heart transplantation. Daratumumab was well tolerated 
and without any serious adverse events. By the time of this publication, 5 of 
the total of 6 patients enrolled have been successfully transplanted. None of 
the patients enrolled experienced AMR and maintain normal cardiac allograft 
function.
CONCLUSIONS: Daratumumab monotherapy may be a safe and effective desensitization 
strategy in highly sensitized patients who are otherwise eligible for heart 
transplantation and considered too ill for other desensitization strategies.

BACKGROUND: Recurrent pericarditis (RP) guidelines recommend second-line 
corticosteroids after aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/colchicine, 
but complications of protracted use underscore the importance of 
corticosteroid-sparing strategies.
OBJECTIVES: Given clinical trial evidence supporting interleukin (IL)-1 pathway 
inhibition and US Food and Drug Administration approval of rilonacept in RP, the 
objective was to assess temporal trends in corticosteroid-sparing treatment of 
RP in a multicenter registry.
METHODS: RESONANCE (REgiStry Of the NAtural history of recurreNt periCarditis in 
pEdiatric and adult patients; NCT04687358) combines retrospective and 
prospective data from clinical practice into a single observation period. 
Patients receiving treatment for idiopathic and postprocedural RP were included. 
Demographics and treatment intensifications were quantified.
RESULTS: Of 313 patients with aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs/colchicine treatment (median disease duration 1.9 years; 1 preenrollment 
recurrence), 44% (n = 138) intensified treatment. Before rilonacept approval in 
RP, 71% (n = 10) of patients intensified to corticosteroids for second-line 
therapy, and 29% (n = 4) intensified to IL-1 pathway inhibition. After 
rilonacept approval, the proportion of patients intensifying to second-line IL-1 
pathway inhibition increased to 64% by 2023 (n = 27; rilonacept: 57%, anakinra: 
7%), whereas the proportion of patients intensifying to corticosteroids 
decreased to 33% (n = 14), P = 0.02. Approximately 59% (n = 35) of second-line 
corticosteroid initiators later transitioned to IL-1 pathway inhibition. In 
patients starting second-line IL-1 pathway inhibition, 5% (n = 3, rilonacept) 
and 25% (n = 4, anakinra) subsequently used corticosteroids for >30 days.
CONCLUSIONS: In RESONANCE, IL-1 pathway inhibition increasingly replaced 
corticosteroids as second-line therapy. Most patients starting corticosteroids 
transitioned to IL-1 pathway inhibition; few transitioned from second-line IL-1 
pathway inhibition to long-term corticosteroids. These findings may inform 
treatment algorithms and patient-provider decision-making.

BACKGROUND: There is marked variability in device-related (DR) infection 
frequencies across HeartMate 3 (HM3) centers. The goal is to correlate center 
driveline (DL) management and infection mitigation practices with DR-infection 
development, laying foundation for development of best practice recommendations 
for one facet of HM3 patient care.
METHODS: Coordinators at 30 HM3 centers were surveyed about center practices for 
infection prophylaxis, intraoperative DL placement and postoperative care, and 
infection mitigation. Early (≤90 days) and late (>90 day) center DR-infection 
frequencies were calculated from Society of Thoracic Surgeons Intermacs data 
linkage. Correlations between center practice patterns and incident DR-infection 
were examined with multivariable Cox modeling (clustering adjusted hazard ratio 
[aHR]).
RESULTS: Within Intermacs (3,725 patients), 1-year freedom from DR-infection was 
87% (80.6-87.3%). Initially, DL dressing changes were performed daily, weekly, 
and variably at 48%, 21% and 31% of centers. After 4 weeks, 57% deescalated 
dressing changes to weekly. Chlorhexidine cleanser with a silver-impregnated 
dressing (Chl-Sil) was standard at 52.7% of programs; 47.3% used chlorhexidine 
alone or other supplies. Use of Chl-Sil was associated with reduced early (aHR 
0.48, p=0.004) and late (aHR 0.64, p=0.02) DR-infection while frequent dressing 
changes conferred higher late DR-infection (aHR 1.4, p=0.05). Antibiotic 
prophylaxis, DL tunneling, and diabetes practices did not correlate with 
DR-infection.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the burden of DR-infections, best practice recommendations 
are needed to standardize care. Application of Chl-Sil DL dressings could be a 
first step in achieving care standardization, while frequent dressing changes 
following DL incorporation should be avoided.

BACKGROUND: Pickleball is a rapidly growing sport, with participation increasing 
from 4.8 million players in 2021 to 19.8 million in 2024 in the United States. 
While injury patterns in adults have been studied, pediatric injury patterns 
remain poorly understood. In this study, we sought to examine the epidemiology 
of pediatric pickleball injuries presenting to emergency departments (EDs) 
across the United States.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the National Electronic 
Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) database from 2014 to 2024. 
Pickleball-related injuries were identified via narrative searches. Demographic 
information, injury type, and mechanism were recorded. Univariable logistic 
regression evaluated associations between age and injury characteristics.
RESULTS: An estimated 3011 pediatric pickleball injuries occurred nationally, 
58.4 % occurring in 2024. Most injuries were to males (61.4 %) and to children 
between 13 and 17 years old (57.4 %). Facial Injuries (27.1 %) and lacerations 
(23.8 %) were the most frequent types of injuries. Younger children were more 
likely to sustain a laceration (OR: 0.84, 95 % CI: 0.72-0.98, p = 0.03), and 
older players were more likely to suffer an injury to the knee (OR: 1.46, 95 % 
CI: 1.11-2.05, p = 0.01) or shoulder (OR: 1.82, 95 % CI: 1.13-3.77, p = 0.04). 
Only 4 % of injuries resulted in hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric pickleball injuries show age-specific trends: younger 
children are more prone to lacerations, while older children experience more 
joint injuries, although all injuries tend to be mild. As participation grows, 
understanding these trends is critical for developing age-targeted safety 
measures and prevention strategies.

Photon-counting detector CT is an emerging technology that has the promise to 
dramatically transform clinical practice. It largely overcomes the limitations 
of traditional CT, offering ultra-high spatial resolution, suppression of 
metallic artifact, and reduced radiation dose. We report the case of a 
44-year-old patient presenting with gaze-evoked vision loss and history of a 
retained orbital foreign body. Localization of the foreign body on conventional 
CT was limited by metallic artifacts, and magnetic resonance imaging was 
contraindicated. Photon-counting detector CT effectively localized the foreign 
body and guided management. The potential applications of this newer technology 
in neuro-ophthalmology are still being explored.

In this report, we provide a follow-up analysis of a previously published 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) evaluating the effect of genetic 
polymorphisms on inter-individual variations in cell-mediated immune responses 
to mumps vaccine. Here we report the results of a polygenic score (PGS) analysis 
showing how common variants can predict mumps vaccine response. We found higher 
PGS for IFNγ, IL-2, and TNFα were predictive of higher post-vaccine IFNγ (p 
value = 2e-6), IL-2 (p = 2e-7), and TNFα (p = 0.004) levels, respectively. 
Control of immune responses after vaccination is complex and polygenic in 
nature. Our results suggest that the PGS-based approach enables better capture 
of the combined genetic effects that contribute to mumps vaccine-induced 
immunity, potentially offering a more comprehensive understanding than 
traditional single-variant GWAS. This approach will likely have broad utility in 
studying genetic control of immune responses to other vaccines and to infectious 
diseases.

Intermittent claudication (IC) is the most common symptom of peripheral artery 
disease, which is a growing public health burden in the United States and 
globally. Patients with IC present with a broad spectrum of risk factors, 
comorbid conditions, range of disability, and treatment goals. Informed shared 
decision-making hinges on a comprehensive evaluation of these factors, patient 
education, and knowledge of the latest available evidence. In 2015, the Society 
for Vascular Surgery published a clinical practice guideline on the management 
of asymptomatic peripheral artery disease and IC. An expert writing group was 
commissioned to provide a focused update to this guideline on the management of 
IC. Based on the available evidence from published research conducted since the 
prior guideline, six specific key questions were formulated spanning the areas 
of antithrombotic management, exercise therapy, and revascularization for IC. A 
systematic review and evidence synthesis of each question was conducted by a 
dedicated methodology team. The GRADE approach was employed to describe the 
strength of each recommendation and level of certainty of evidence. The review 
identified major gaps in evidence particularly in the arena of comparative 
effectiveness for interventions (exercise, revascularization) across defined 
clinical subgroups and employing meaningful patient-centered outcomes. Twelve 
recommendations, among which are two best practice statements, are provided in 
this focused update. They address the use of dual pathway antithrombotic 
strategies, the role and type of exercise therapy, endovascular interventions 
for femoropopliteal and infrapopliteal disease, and the identification of 
specific risk factors that should be incorporated into shared decision-making 
around revascularization. A comprehensive and individualized approach to the 
management of patients with IC, relying first on education, risk factor control, 
optimal medical therapy, and exercise, is emphasized. A rubric for 
decision-making that includes a thorough assessment of risk, benefits, degree of 
impairment, and treatment durability, is considered fundamental to a 
patient-centered approach in IC. Significant unmet research needs in this field 
are also enumerated.

Nurse anesthesiology programs continue to search for the best student traits 
and/or qualities to determine success in transitioning through a program of 
study and passing the National Certification Examination. These traits are not 
always quantitative in nature, but qualitative. Students face many stressors in 
transitioning through a nurse anesthesiology training program, and how students 
cope with those stressors may clue in the nurse anesthesia educators as to what 
determines success. This pilot study aimed to determine whether grit, or 
perseverance toward meeting a long-term goal, was a trait worth considering in 
determining student success. To that end, this cross-sectional quantitative 
correlational pilot study conducted in two nurse anesthesiology programs found 
that one grit subscale--Perseverance of Effort--was statistically significant in 
determining student success as defined herein.

Innovation and the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) are essential in 
addressing the evolving challenges in healthcare, enhancing patient care, and 
supporting nursing practice. This article explores the opportunities associated 
with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) in nursing, considerations for 
how to leverage it to augment the work of nursing, and strategies to accelerate 
its adoption. By engaging in interprofessional collaboration, leveraging 
technology, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, nurses can lead 
transformative changes in healthcare delivery. The article also highlights case 
studies from Mercy and Mayo Clinic, demonstrating the practical implications and 
successful implementation of AI in nursing practice. These examples emphasize 
the importance of strategic planning, ethical considerations, and active 
involvement of frontline nurses in the design and adoption of AI technologies.

BACKGROUND: Urinary stone disease with a clear genetic cause, monogenic stone 
disease (MSD), is increasingly recognized as a significant proportion of the 
total population. When MSD is suspected, genetic testing provides a firm 
diagnosis that can alter management and treatment. Here we present testing 
results from a large cohort with suspected MSD.
METHODS: Subjects with features suggestive of MSD (early onset, family history, 
frequent stones, nephrocalcinosis [NC], and/or CKD) were recruited by the Rare 
Kidney Stone Consortium and genotyped for up to 160 known or candidate MSD genes 
via a targeted massively parallel sequencing (tMPS) panel. We compared clinical 
and biochemical features between genetically resolved MSD and unresolved 
individuals.
RESULTS: Of 426 families (657 patients) enrolled, 145 (34%) were resolved with 
identified disease associated variants in 22 known MSD genes. Ninety-nine 
families were biallelic, 37 monoallelic, and 2 digenic. An additional 21 of the 
231 screened family members were resolved. Genes identified in 10 or more 
families were: AGXT, HOGA1, SLC34A3, CYP24A1, SLC3A1, and CLCN5. Compared to the 
unresolved group, MSD probands had a lower baseline and last visit estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), earlier age of stone presentation, and more 
stone events and procedures/year of life. The resolve rate was higher in those 
less than 16 years, and NC was seen earlier in the MSD group. Overall, NC was a 
risk factor for lower eGFR. Among the specific disorders, primary hyperoxaluria 
patients had the earliest age of stone and NC diagnosis, and as expected, the 
highest urinary oxalate level.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes the value of selecting patients enriched for 
factors associated with MSD, and comprehensive genetic testing to achieve a high 
yield of genetic diagnoses. Significant clinical and biochemical characteristics 
of MSD patients were defined. A definitive MSD diagnosis facilitates 
individualized management and strategies to delay disease progression in 
probands and affected family members.

In response to the World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Initiative on 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Health, the World Endoscopy Organization (WEO) 
highlights the unique challenges and opportunities AI presents for 
gastrointestinal endoscopy, particularly in resource-limited settings. While AI 
technologies have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency 
in high-resource environments, their implementation in low- and middle-income 
countries is hindered by infrastructural, economic, regulatory, and training 
barriers. This commentary explores how these challenges may exacerbate existing 
healthcare disparities, emphasizing the need for localized datasets, affordable 
AI models, simplified regulatory frameworks, and workforce capacity building. 
The WEO supports WHO's call for equitable AI deployment and advocates for 
region-specific solutions, including mobile and offline AI tools, public-private 
partnerships, locally developed algorithms aligned with prevalent disease 
patterns, and a flexibly adapted regulatory framework. By leveraging WEO's 
training networks and fostering collaboration among governments, clinicians, and 
industry, the integration of AI into endoscopy can become more accessible and 
relevant to underserved populations. The commentary underscores that AI should 
not be seen as a luxury but as a tool to bridge global disparities in care 
quality. Ensuring responsible and inclusive AI integration requires both global 
coordination and context-specific adaptations to truly benefit all healthcare 
systems.

Disease response and progression assessment in multiple myeloma is based on 
various measurements of monoclonal protein (serum and urine protein 
electrophoresis, serum free light chain, and/or quantitative immunoglobulins). 
Currently, the International Myeloma Working Group consensus response criteria 
require 2 sequential assessments of any 1 marker made at any time before 
confirmation of disease progression and the institution of any new therapy. 
However, this can be cumbersome in clinical trials. Herein, we hypothesized that 
if 2 markers meet the progression criteria simultaneously, a repeat of either 
will not be necessary for confirmation. We retrospectively studied all 
sequential patients with myeloma enrolled in clinical trials at Mayo Clinic. We 
identified 583 episodes of confirmed progression in our study. Among the 583 
progression episodes, nearly 70% (sensitivity of the simultaneous criteria) met 
the 2 simultaneous variable criteria at the first testing, indicating 
progression. Conversely, among 413 patients who met progression criteria by 2 
simultaneous values, 98% (specificity of the simultaneous criteria) of patients 
subsequently had confirmed progression by sequential values. In summary, for 
patients with 2 disease burden markers meeting the simultaneous progression 
criteria, sequential assessment of either 1 for confirmation may not be 
necessary to determine disease progression.

OBJECTIVE: Real-world assessment of trainee surgical competence and autonomy 
must occur in the operative environment. It is unclear if or how workplace-based 
operative skills assessments are systematically incorporated into summative 
evaluations. In this study, intraoperative surgical skills assessment tools were 
reviewed for actual or proposed incorporation into summative evaluations.
DESIGN: A scoping review was conducted. The Cochrane Central Registrar of 
Clinical Trials, Embase, Medline, and Web of Science were searched for articles 
published from January 2012 to December 2021. Articles describing an educational 
assessment paradigm of a post-graduate surgical trainee performing an open 
surgical procedure were selected. Using the PRISMA Extension Guidelines for 
Scoping Reviews, two independent reviewers completed data extraction including 
literature quality, assessment paradigm, assessment quality, incorporation into 
summative evaluations, and facilitators and barriers to implementation. Finally, 
a narrative synthesis of extracted data was completed.
RESULTS: Twenty-two articles met inclusion criteria describing 11 different 
surgical assessments. All were cohort studies, of which 21 involved the 
evaluation of an assessment tool and one involved participant perceptions of the 
assessment tool. All studies discussed the possible use of their assessment to 
track progress over time, but no study explicitly outlined the incorporation of 
the tool into a summative review. Four types of assessments automatically 
integrated results, which reportedly were utilized at Clinical Competency 
Committee (CCC) meetings. Facilitators and barriers of surgical assessment 
integration into summative assessments was not described.
CONCLUSIONS: While proponents of formative intra-operative assessment have 
claimed that their potential use in supporting summative evaluation and tracking 
learning trajectories are major benefits, a systematic method of integrating 
workplace surgical assessments into summative resident evaluation has not been 
described or uniformly implemented.

Satiation, the process that regulates meal size and termination, varies widely 
among adults with obesity. To better understand and leverage this variability, 
we assessed calories to satiation (CTS) through an ad libitum meal, combined 
with physiological and behavioral evaluations, including calorimetry, imaging, 
blood sampling, and gastric emptying tests. Although factors like baseline 
characteristics, body composition, and hormone levels partially explain CTS 
variability, they leave substantial variability unaccounted for. To address this 
gap, we developed a machine-learning-assisted genetic risk score (CTSGRS) to 
predict high CTS. In a randomized clinical trial, participants with high CTS or 
CTSGRS achieved greater weight loss with phentermine-topiramate over 52 weeks, 
whereas those with low CTS or CTSGRS responded better to liraglutide at 16 weeks 
in a separate trial. These findings highlight the potential of combining 
satiation measurements with genetic modeling to predict treatment outcomes and 
inform personalized strategies for obesity management.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the long-term outcomes in patients with 
melanoma involving the eyelid and conjunctiva.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with biopsy-confirmed melanoma involving the eyelid and 
conjunctiva.
METHODS: We investigated 13 patients from a single academic center with 
biopsy-confirmed melanoma involving the eyelid and conjunctiva between January 
2000 and December 2021. Primary endpoints included local recurrence, metastasis, 
and death.
RESULTS: Presumed origin of melanoma was conjunctiva in 9 patients (69%), eyelid 
in 3 patients (23%), and indeterminate in 1 patient (8%). Primary treatment was 
exenteration in 3 patients (23%), full-thickness resection in 3 patients (23%), 
Mohs micrographic surgery in 4 patients (31%), and nonsurgical treatment in 3 
patients (23%). Four patients (31%) underwent secondary exenteration due to 
tumour recurrence. Local tumour recurrence occurred in 7 patients (54%) after a 
mean 43 months (5-167) and metastasis in 4 patients (31%) after mean 29 months 
(16-46). Five patients (38%) died after a mean of 45 months (16-107) after 
initial melanoma diagnosis. There were 3 (23%) deaths attributable to melanoma; 
all had undergone exenteration during their treatment course. In the 7 (54%) 
patients managed with globe-sparing treatment, all had best-corrected visual 
acuity of 20/60 or better at last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, there was a high rate of local recurrence, 
metastasis, and death, regardless of whether patients received globe sparing or 
non-globe sparing treatment.

Background  A retrospective review was performed of 15 adult patients who 
underwent arthroscopic suture anchor scapholunate capsuloligamentous repair 
between 2021 and 2023. Materials and Methods  There were 12 male and 3 female 
patients, with a mean age of 44.9 years. Eight patients had European Wrist 
Arthroscopy Society (EWAS) II (Geissler II), four patients had EWAS IIIC 
(Geissler III), and three patients had EWAS IV (Geissler IV). After a follow-up 
of 12 months (12-26), the mean grip strength significantly improved by 131% 
compared with presurgery. There was a significant improvement in the visual 
analog scale score from 6 to 1.2, the Mayo Wrist Score from 43.5 to 86.5, and 
the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire score from 
65.9 to 6.5. Two EWAS IV patients had recurrent symptomatic scapholunate 
diastasis requiring scapholunate ligamentoplasty. Conclusion  The arthroscopic 
dorsal scapholunate capsuloligamentous repair with suture anchors is a reliable 
and safe technique with minimal complications. It is recommended for reducible 
acute or chronic injury to the scapholunate ligament complex with suspected 
avulsion injury. Level of Evidence  Level IV.

IMPORTANCE: Lung cancer and pulmonary metastases remain the leading cause of 
cancer-related mortality. While surgery is the gold standard, local 
tissue-ablative therapies are increasingly used in unresectable disease or 
inoperable patients. Minimally invasive local control presents a safe, 
repeatable approach to slow disease progression and prolong survival.
OBSERVATIONS: Ablative techniques (radiofrequency, microwave, cryoablation, 
pulsed electric field) utilize extreme heat, cold, or energy to induce cancer 
cell death. Traditionally, ablation occurred percutaneously with image guidance, 
but transbronchial approaches are gaining popularity due to a potentially 
improved complication profile with reduced tumoral seeding. Stereotactic body 
radiotherapy utilizes non-invasive, precise radiation with a steep dose fall-off 
to protect peritumoral tissue. Transarterial infusions via transarterial 
chemoembolization and intraarterial chemoperfusion are emerging approaches that 
exploit tumor vasculature to provide focal cytotoxicity and ischemia. 
Intratumoral injectables (chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiosensitization, 
oncolytic viruses, adoptive cell therapy, and chimeric antigen receptor T-cell 
therapy) directly target the tumor microenvironment, potentially increasing 
efficacy whilst minimizing systemic adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the age of individualized cancer therapy, a 
multidisciplinary approach with concurrent modalities can achieve local control. 
This review provides a comprehensive discussion regarding the role and types of 
local control, safety, efficacy, and survival outcomes in assessing 
percutaneous, transbronchial, intraarterial, and intratumoral approaches in 
nonsurgical patients.

Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β 
cells, resulting in permanent loss of glucose homeostasis. Islet transplantation 
is a promising potential cure that remains hindered by immune rejection. We 
previously showed that ST8Sia6 expression on tumors reduced immune surveillance 
and hypothesized that this sialyltransferase could protect β cells from 
autoimmune destruction. Here, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of ST8Sia6 
in β cells of female nonobese diabetic mice (NOD βST) decreased the spontaneous 
incidence of diabetes by 90% and preserved β cell mass. NOD βST mice had 
comparable insulitis at 8 weeks of age that did not progress over time compared 
with littermate controls. β Cell-autoreactive B and T cells were present in NOD 
βST mice, indicating a peripheral rather than central mechanism of immune 
tolerance. The islets of NOD βST mice displayed a dampened type 1 immune 
response and reduced IL-12p35 expression in dendritic cells compared with those 
of littermate controls. The peripheral protection persisted even after removal 
of ST8Sia6 expression at 20 weeks of age, indicating that transient expression 
was sufficient for establishment of tolerance. These results demonstrate that 
ST8Sia6 protects β cells from immune-mediated attack and rejection, highlighting 
its therapeutic potential for autoimmune disorders.

RATIONALE: Chronic lung diseases, including COPD and bronchiectasis (BE), may 
differ by sex in symptom onset, diagnostic delays, and disease burden. This 
study examined healthcare experiences and symptom burden among individuals with 
self-reported COPD, BE, or non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from an online survey of U.S. 
and international participants with self-reported COPD, BE, or NTM, recruited 
via COPD Foundation (COPDF) social media. The questionnaire, developed with 
input from COPDF leadership, physician-researchers, and patient stakeholders, 
assessed healthcare experiences, disease burden, and symptoms. A subset of women 
answered menopause-related questions. Descriptive statistics were compared by 
sex and disease group: COPD (with/without BE or NTM) and BE (with/without NTM). 
T-tests assessed continuous variables; chi-square or Fisher's exact tests 
analyzed categorical variables.
RESULTS: Among 632 respondents (mean age 70±9 years, 74% women), 68% reported 
COPD and 32% BE. Women with COPD were younger (p=0.048) and sought care sooner 
after symptom onset (p<0.010) than men. More women with COPD didn't have their 
diagnosis explained by a healthcare provider (p=0.038) and reported 
diagnosis-related anxiety, depression, or fear (p=0.007). Among participants 
with BE, men were more likely to receive a confirmed diagnosis sooner (p=0.038) 
and during hospitalization (p=0.024). Disease management burden, pulmonologist 
visit frequency, CAAT scores, numbers of comorbidities, and financial burden 
were similar across groups. Over 75% of women were postmenopausal, and one-third 
reported worsened pulmonary symptoms post-menopause.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in diagnostic delays and symptom burden highlight the 
need for further research into healthcare disparities to improve pulmonary care 
and outcomes.

PURPOSE: Cenobamate is approved for treating focal epilepsy and has potential 
for treating tumor-related epilepsy (TRE) based on potential anti-tumor effects, 
though there is little data on efficacy and safety in this patient population.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, multi-center study of patients with TRE who 
were prescribed cenobamate as adjunctive treatment between January 2020 and 
November 2024 at Mayo Clinic in Florida, Minnesota, and Arizona. Drug efficacy 
was assessed, and factors that were predictive of response to treatment were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were included, with 12 being drug resistant. The 
median seizure frequency for the entire group before starting cenobamate 
treatment was 12 (IQR = 4-64) per month, and after treatment at last follow-up 
was 3 (IQR = 1-15) per month, with an overall 56.3% reduction. Four patients 
(23.5%) were seizure-free, and 7 (41.1%) patients were responders (at least 50% 
seizure reduction). No adverse events were reported for patients on concurrent 
chemotherapy. Responders had significantly fewer seizures per month compared to 
non-responders (5.72 ± 10.29 vs. 27.33 ± 30.17; p = .030). No clinical factors 
were predictive of responsiveness (or lack thereof) to cenobamate.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that adjunctive therapy with cenobamate 
treatment for TRE is a feasible and potentially effective option. Clinical 
history, including drug resistance, did not predict drug efficacy. No adverse 
effects were reported in those treated with chemotherapy. Further studies are 
needed to validate treatment response and safety.

Tumour-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy has emerged as a promising adoptive 
cell transfer strategy for solid tumours. The recent accelerated approval of 
lifileucel by the Food and Drug Administration marks a significant milestone in 
the clinical application of TIL therapy. This review comprehensively examines 
the historical development, biology, clinical efficacy, safety and limitations 
of TIL therapy. We explore advancements in TIL manufacturing, including novel 
culture techniques, genetic modifications and automation, to enhance scalability 
and effectiveness. Despite promising results, TIL therapy faces challenges such 
as high-dose interleukin-2 toxicity, complex manufacturing processes and immune 
evasion mechanisms. Emerging strategies, including checkpoint inhibitor 
combinations, engineered TIL constructs and metabolic reprogramming, aim to 
improve TIL therapeutic efficacy. This review provides insights into the 
evolving landscape of TIL therapy and its potential to enhance current cancer 
immunotherapy.

Modern radiology relies entirely on digital imaging systems. Health care records 
draw cybercriminals' attention. On-site and cloud-based informatics systems, 
including artificial intelligence, can boost efficiency but also create weak 
points. Medical imaging systems must safeguard patient identities, control 
access, secure devices, and coordinate with patients, payers, and billing 
partners. Endorsed by the ACR and the Society for Imaging Informatics in 
Medicine, this white paper outlines steps to fortify the medical imaging 
pipeline methodically, train caregivers on the frontline, and develop incident 
response and recovery strategies for data breaches and disabling ransomware 
attacks. Additionally, building a culture of safety in imaging involves 
conducting routine simulations and actively engaging leadership. Taken together, 
these multidisciplinary interventions can minimize the clinical impact and 
operational implications of cybersecurity events, thereby maintaining patient 
trust in an increasingly interconnected imaging workflow.

BACKGROUND: Patients with short bowel syndrome-associated intestinal failure 
(SBS-IF) require complex, personalized, and multidisciplinary care; however, 
there are disparities in access. This study measured the impact of unmet needs 
and treatment burden among patients and their caregivers.
METHODS: This cross-sectional, mixed-method study included US adults 
self-reporting SBS-IF and receiving home parenteral nutrition for ≥6 months and 
their caregivers. One-hour interviews informed the development of a 30-min 
survey administered to participants from an online health community.
RESULTS: Among 68 patients, the mean age was 42 years, 79% were female, and 88% 
were White. Most of the 16 caregivers were female (69%), and younger than 45 
years (69%). Of 32 patients (47%) receiving care from an SBS specialist, only 19 
(59%) were referred after diagnosis; in 58% of these, referral occurred >6 
months after diagnosis. Depression was reported in 44 patients (65%), with 54% 
not receiving professional mental health care. Financial concerns were common, 
with 44 patients (65%) unable to work and 40 patients (59%) reporting annual 
household income of <$50,000. Of 32 patients reporting difficulty paying medical 
bills, 22 (32%) could not fill prescriptions and 19 (28%) canceled/delayed 
healthcare provider visits. Social determinant of health challenges were 
reported by 44 patients (65%). Caregivers' responsibilities impacted their 
ability to work (50%) and future outlook (63%).
CONCLUSION: Patients with SBS-IF face difficulties accessing specialized 
healthcare, and are at risk of adverse healthcare outcomes, financial hardships, 
and poor quality of life. Mental health and work/financial issues were common 
among both patients and caregivers.

PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the association between antimicrobial 
practices, including oral antibiotics, intravenous antibiotics, antifungal 
prophylaxis, and infection outcomes in patients undergoing primary or revision 
inflatable penile prosthesis surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cohort study of 
5,261 patients who underwent primary or revision inflatable penile prosthesis 
surgery at 16 specialized centers across the United States, Europe, and Korea 
from July 2016 to July 2021. Patient data included demographic and clinical 
characteristics, antibiotic and antifungal administration, and infection 
outcomes. The primary outcome was infection following inflatable penile 
prosthesis placement. Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were 
performed to identify predictors of infection.
RESULTS: The overall infection rate was 1.9% (n=102), with higher rates among 
diabetic patients (p=0.023), those with prior inflatable penile prosthesis 
infection (p<0.001), or undergoing revision surgery (p<0.001). Multivariable 
analysis identified diabetes (OR=1.68, p=0.022) and previous inflatable penile 
prosthesis infection (OR=4.67, p<0.001) as independent risk factors for 
infection. Perioperative intravenous antifungal use was significantly associated 
with a lower infection risk (OR=0.22, p<0.001), while postoperative oral 
antibiotics (p=0.5) and prolonged intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis (>24 hours) 
(p=0.2) did not demonstrate protective effects. Pre- and postoperative oral 
antibiotics were not associated with a statistically significant reduction in 
infection after adjustment for confounding variables.
CONCLUSIONS: This large multicenter study highlights a significant association 
between perioperative antifungal prophylaxis and lower infection risk in 
inflatable penile prosthesis surgery while demonstrating the limited utility of 
preoperative and postoperative oral antibiotics and prolonged intravenous 
prophylaxis. These findings support evidence-based antimicrobial stewardship to 
optimize outcomes and minimize complications, including antibiotic resistance.

BACKGROUND: The Michigan Bariatric Surgery Collaborative (MBSC) has developed an 
app that calculates outcomes, to include predicted weight loss and venous 
thromboembolism rates. The app is called Weigh the Odds. This app provides an 
important method for discussing outcomes with patients.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the validity of the MBSC outcomes calculator 
in a Hispanic population.
SETTING: Community practice in Texas.
METHODS: A community practice with a large percentage of Hispanic patients was 
used to validate the MBSC calculator. The correlation coefficient was 
calculated. A chi-square test was used to compare quantitative variables between 
the operation types. Lin's concordance correlation along with the Bland-Altman 
plot were performed to estimate the level of agreement between actual and 
expected weights at 1 year.
RESULTS: Two hundred seventy-six patients met the eligibility criteria and were 
included in the study. The average body mass index (BMI) at the time of initial 
bariatric surgery was 45.2 kg/m2 (standard deviation [SD], 6.68). One hundred 
seventy-seven patients underwent sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and 99 patients 
underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as their initial bariatric operation. 
The mean actual weight at 1 year for the entire cohort was 90.8 kg (SD, 19.6), 
while the mean expected weight was 89.2 kg (SD, 16.9), leading to a mean 
difference of 1.6 kg. The concordance correlation coefficient of .80 (95% CI: 
.76-.84, P < .001) demonstrates a strong agreement between actual and expected 
weights at 1 year. There was a lower correlation coefficient for RYGB patients.
CONCLUSION: The concordance correlation coefficient demonstrated a strong 
agreement between actual and expected weights at 1 year. These findings validate 
the MBSC outcomes calculator in a Hispanic population.

BACKGROUND: Worsening heart failure (WHF) events, whether or not leading to 
hospitalization, may reflect therapeutic benefits of an intervention.
OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to assess the associations between an expanded 
definition of WHF and treatment effect, mortality and change in Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary Score.
METHODS: In the randomized REDUCE LAP-HF II (A Study to Evaluate the Corvia 
Medical, Inc IASD System II to Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients 
With Heart Failure) trial of atrial shunt vs sham control procedure, WHF was 
classified as level 1 (hospitalization requiring intravenous diuretics), level 2 
(urgent outpatient encounters with diuretic intensification), or level 3 
(nonurgent encounters with augmentation of oral diuretics). Patients were 
classified as responders/nonresponders based on peak exercise pulmonary vascular 
resistance or presence of a pacemaker device, as previously published.
RESULTS: By 24 months, 161 (25.9%) of 621 patients had at least 1 WHF event, 
including 108 (17.4%) with any level 1 WHF event, 22 (3.5%) with a level 2 WHF 
event, and 31 (5.0%) with only level 3 WHF events. In the overall population, 
there were no differences for shunt vs control device by any definition. In a 
recurrent events analysis in the responder group, a numerical difference in 
favor of the atrial shunt was present for level 1 WHF alone but increased and 
became statistically significant with inclusion of level 2 and level 3 events. 
Level 1 WHF, but not level 2 or 3, was associated with higher mortality (HR: 
3.54 [95% CI: 1.83-6.87]; P = 0.0002). Inclusion of level 2 and 3 events 
strengthened the association of WHF with less favorable changes in Kansas City 
Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Overall Summary Score.
CONCLUSIONS: An expanded definition of WHF more clearly identified the treatment 
effect of an atrial shunt in a responder group and the negative association of 
WHF with change in quality of life. (A Study to Evaluate the Corvia Medical, Inc 
IASD System II to Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients With Heart 
Failure [REDUCE LAP-HF TRIAL II]; NCT03088033).

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether novel dialysis delivery models, such as 
telehealth visits combined with face-to-face visits in a hybrid model 
(telehealth hybrid model), positively influence clinical outcomes and healthcare 
utilization.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compares the rates of 
emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and Medicare established 
hemodialysis quality metrics before and after implementation of a telehealth 
hybrid model focused among rural populations in regions served by the Mayo 
Clinic dialysis system between January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020, versus 
face-to-face visits alone before implementation of the program from January 1, 
2019, to December 31, 2019. In addition, we used a standardized anonymous survey 
to examine patient perspectives toward the implementation of telehealth at the 
dialysis units.
RESULTS: No significant differences in health care utilization outcomes 
(emergency department visits: Incidence rate ratios, 95% CI, 0.87 (0.62-1.22); 
P=.41; hospitalizations: Incidence rate ratios, 95% CI, 0.92 (0.63-1.35); P=.68) 
or clinical outcomes (abnormal laboratory measures) between the telehealth and 
standard care groups were observed. Patient satisfaction with telehealth was 
high, with 90% reporting successful video visits.
CONCLUSION: Our study provides evidence suggesting that the telehealth hybrid 
model can deliver nephrology care comparable to traditional care models in 
in-center dialysis without negatively impacting clinical outcomes, health care 
utilization, or patient satisfaction. Further research is necessary to confirm 
these results in other settings and to explore the long-term impacts of such 
hybrid care models.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: Teclistamab, a novel bispecific monoclonal antibody 
targeting CD3 and B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), and chimeric antigen 
receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy are promising options for treating 
relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). However, the rates of acute kidney 
injury (AKI) associated with teclistamab remain inadequately characterized. This 
study aims to compare the incidence, severity, and outcomes of AKI between 
patients receiving teclistamab and CAR-T therapy.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving 64 patients with 
relapsed/refractory MM treated with either teclistamab or CAR-T therapy. All 
patients had previously received at least four lines of chemotherapy before 
being treated with either teclistamab or CAR-T. The primary outcome was the 
incidence of AKI, and secondary outcomes included AKI severity, kidney recovery 
rates, and mortality. Kaplan-Meier estimates for AKI-free survival were 
calculated, and hazard ratios (HRs) for AKI risk were determined using Cox 
proportional hazards models.
RESULTS: Sixty-four patients met inclusion criteria for this study (30 received 
CAR-T and 34 received teclistamab therapy). Among these patients, 14 AKI events 
occurred in total (22%), with 10 events (29%) in the teclistamab group and four 
events (13%) in the CAR-T group. AKI-free survival estimates at 180 days after 
treatment initiation were 68% [95% confidence interval (CI): 53%-87%] for 
teclistamab patients and 90% (95% CI: 79%-100%) for CAR-T patients. While 
patients receiving teclistamab were found to have an increased risk of an AKI 
event compared to those receiving CAR-T therapy, the results were not 
statistically significant [HR (95% CI): 3.38 (0.93-12.31), P = .065].
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that patients treated with teclistamab may 
experience a higher incidence of AKI compared to those receiving CAR-T therapy. 
However, further research is required to determine whether this increased risk 
is attributable to disease progression or teclistamab itself. These results 
highlight the need for close kidney function monitoring in patients receiving 
teclistamab.

PURPOSE: Statistically standardized estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone 
receptor (PgR) differentiated prognosis. Here we examined statistically 
standardized human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2).
METHODS: CCTG MA.27 (NCT00066573) was an adjuvant phase III trial of exemestane 
versus anastrozole in postmenopausal women with ER + and/or PgR + tumors. We 
centrally quantitated machine-image immunohistochemical HER2, defined American 
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) 
dual-probe FISH HER2/CEP17 categories, determined ultra-low HER2 (IHC 0 with 
(0,10%] 1 + stain), and standardized HER2 to mean 0, standard deviation 1. 
Univariate distant disease-free survival (DDFS) was described with Kaplan-Meier 
plots and examined with Wilcoxon (Peto-Prentice) test statistic. Adjusted Cox 
multivariable regressions 2-sided Wald tests had nominal significance p < 0.05.
RESULTS: Of 7576 women, 2900 had ER results; 2726, PgR; 2680, HER2; and 2325, 
ER/PgR/HER2 for multivariable investigations. ASCO/CAP categorization 
significantly differentiated univariate DDFS (p = 0.01), although not values of 
IHC 0 (N = 864) and ultra-low HER2 (N = 1143). Statistical standardization did 
not differentiate univariate DDFS (p = 0.08-0.27); however, (natural logarithm-) 
standardized values ≤ - 1.0 (ultra-low 1 + /2 + /3 + HSCORE, or % + , < 0.1) 
were similar to > 1.0 (HSCORE > 19; % +  > 14). Neither ASCO/CAP, nor 
statistically standardized, ER (p = 0.65-0.94) or HER2 (p = 0.20-0.97) were 
associated with DDFS in models with PgR; higher PgR had better DDFS (p ≤ .003).
CONCLUSIONS: ASCO/CAP categories significantly differentiated DDFS, while 
statistical standardization did not. Patients with ultra-low HER2 and IHC 0 
without stain had similar 5-year DDFS, while standardization indicated similar 
prognosis for very low 1 + /2 + /3 + and highest HER2 stain. We caution about 
assessment of ultra-low, or very low, HER2 due to HER2 assay dynamic range.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Recent changes in European diagnostic criteria allow 
for serologic diagnosis of celiac disease in children. Those guidelines have not 
been adopted in North America; hence, we aim to assess the positive predictive 
value (PPV) of tissue transglutaminase (tTG) immunoglobulin A (IgA) assays used 
in North America in identifying histologic findings of celiac disease.
METHODS: Multicenter retrospective cohort study of children (<18 years) with an 
elevated tTG IgA within 6 months of an esophagogastroduodenoscopy between 
January 2016 and December 2021. Biopsy-confirmed celiac disease was determined 
by the presence of intraepithelial lymphocytosis and villous atrophy. The 
primary outcomes were the PPV of an elevated tTG IgA and tTG IgA greater than or 
equal to 10 times the upper limit of normal (10× ULN).
RESULTS: Overall, 4019 children (63.3% female; 9% type 1 diabetes, 2% Down 
syndrome) were included. Histologic findings were consistent with celiac disease 
for 3321 children (PPV = 82.6% [95% CI, 81.4-83.8]). Among the 1739/4019 (43.2%) 
children with tTG IgA greater than or equal to 10× ULN, 1651 had 
biopsy-confirmed celiac disease (PPV10× = 94.9% [95% CI, 93.8-95.9]). Five 
percent (88/1739) of children did not have histologic findings of celiac 
disease, including 41/1739 (2%) with normal histology. Diagnostic accuracy of 
tTG IgA varied widely among assays used in North America (PPV range: 
71.5%-88.8%; PPV10× range: 89.3%-97.3%). Assays performed worse in children with 
type 1 diabetes (PPV10× 89% [95% CI, 83.5-92.8]).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated tTG IgA in isolation is insufficient to confidently 
diagnose celiac disease. As tTG assay performance varied widely, diagnostic 
confirmation by a specialist prior to dietary changes is essential.

BACKGROUND: Given the substantial overlap between renal and pulmonary systems, 
understanding the role of kidney replacement therapy (KRT) in alleviating 
respiratory complications is essential for managing patients with concurrent 
kidney and lung dysfunction. This study evaluated the impact of KRT, including 
hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, on lung mechanics and respiratory 
function, especially in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation.
METHODS: PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched up to 
October 8, 2024. Studies were selected using prespecified criteria and analyzed 
using R. Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 test; study quality was 
evaluated using ROBINS-IV2. This project is registered in PROSPERO with ID 
CRD420251106970.
RESULTS: Seven studies (10 cohorts, 436 patients; 59.4 % male; mean age 
49.5-73.2) were included. KRT significantly improved static lung compliance (MD 
10.34; 95 % CI 5.46-15.41; p < 0.01), especially with PD in ICU patients (MD 
17.20; 95 % CI 10.54-23.86; p < 0.01). No significant effects were found on 
dynamic compliance, respiratory resistance, or most pulmonary indices. 
Oxygenation showed a borderline improvement (MD 41.20; 95 % CI 0.62-81.78; 
p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the potential benefits of KRT in improving 
static lung compliance in ICU patients, especially with PD. However, 
improvements in oxygenation efficiency remain limited and inconsistent, likely 
due to the complexities of critical care factors. The lack of adequate reporting 
on potential mediators of KRT's impact on pulmonary function prevents us from 
drawing firm conclusions.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a critical condition characterized by 
increased intra-abdominal pressure and, if left untreated, can cause organ 
dysfunction and multiorgan failure. We present a case of an elderly man who 
developed ACS secondary to hemoperitoneum from a splenic artery laceration after 
multiple falls. Despite successful arterial embolization, the patients' ACS 
worsened considerably. Given his high surgical risk and advanced age, 
percutaneous catheter drainage was performed. The procedure was uneventful and 
led to the resolution of the ACS. This case highlights the importance of early 
recognition and close monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure and the utility of 
minimally invasive strategies for managing ACS in patients with high-surgical 
risk.

Optimizing Nurses' Time: Reducing Assessment Frequency in General Care.

BACKGROUND: Nurses represent a limited resource in the hospital environment. For 
decades, inpatient nurses have conducted head-to-toe assessments in roughly the 
same manner. At Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the practice has been 
twice-daily head-to-toe assessments, without reviewing the benefit of this 
frequency (vis-à-vis once daily) for patients, staff, and the institution.
PURPOSE: This quality improvement (QI) project in a general care setting 
explored whether decreasing comprehensive physical assessments from twice daily 
to once daily was associated with changes in patient safety or care quality. 
Staff satisfaction was also assessed.
METHODS: After a pilot project showed the feasibility of changing to once-daily 
assessments, a QI project was conducted to compare a once-daily frequency of 
head-to-toe assessments with a twice-daily frequency for all adult patients 
admitted to a general medical unit. The intervention period was between August 1 
and October 31, 2023; one assessment was performed between 7 AM and 7 PM in all 
patients not receiving hospice care or requiring more frequent assessments 
because of specific disease processes. Comparison data were obtained from 
patients who were on the unit in the three months before the intervention, from 
May 1 through July 31, 2023. Outcomes were patient safety events, code blue 
events, and rapid response team calls; hospital length of stay; performance 
rates of other required assessments (as a counterbalance measure), including 
delirium, pressure injury, and fall risk; and compliance with the new assessment 
schedule.
RESULTS: At the conclusion of the intervention period, no significant increases 
in reported patient safety events, code blue events, rapid response team calls, 
or hospital length of stay were observed. There were no decreases in compliance 
with required assessments, except for pressure injury, which decreased enough 
during the first month of the intervention to result in a statistically 
significant difference between the pre- and postintervention periods; however, 
compliance returned to baseline by the conclusion of the project. Among nursing 
staff, compliance with the once-daily assessment practice was high (80%), and 
staff feedback was positive; 96% of respondents indicated they would like to see 
the practice continue.
CONCLUSION: The results of this QI project suggest that head-to-toe assessment 
frequency in the adult general medical patient population could be reduced to 
once daily without adversely affecting patient outcomes or safety. Further 
research is warranted to examine whether these results can be extrapolated to 
other units and institutions.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly lethal, aggressive malignancy. Little 
is known about the evolutionary trajectories of HCC and how clinical 
decision-making could be informed based on biopsies of the initial tumour. Here, 
we report the whole-exome sequencing of a unique series of resected HCC tumours 
and matched recurrences. This cohort included patients who received a liver 
transplant and who were immunosuppressed at time of recurrence, in comparison to 
patients who underwent liver resection for HCC and immunocompetent at time of 
recurrence, therefore facilitating analyses of immune selection in driving 
evolutionary divergence. We find extensive evolutionary divergence between 
baseline and recurrent tumours, with the majority of mutations in our cohort 
being private, in the process informing sampling guidelines for precision 
oncology in this disease. We also find no evidence that immunosuppression 
relaxes immune selection pressures, given the absence of a genomic footprint 
reflecting the presentation of neoantigens or altered dynamics of genomic 
evolution. We attribute this to the presence of genetic lesions that confer the 
capabilities of immune evasion in these tumours prior to transplantation, and 
then validate the link between immune selection pressures and the emergence of 
these lesions in publicly available HCC datasets. Our findings point to HCC as a 
cancer with extensive evolutionary divergence over time, partly defined by an 
irreversible, genetically determined trajectory towards immune escape.

BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESIS: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is on 
the rise, and precision strategies to offset the progression to end-stage kidney 
disease are needed. We used a well-established pre-clinical translational model 
of CKD in swine and single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to identify 
potential therapeutic targets via characterization of the renal cell-specific 
transcriptomic landscape.
METHODS: Normal and CKD pigs were studied in vivo and ex vivo after 14 weeks 
(n=6/group). In randomly selected pigs (n=3/group), kidneys were harvested, 
nuclei isolated, libraries prepared, and snRNA-seq performed. Protein expression 
of candidate differentially expressed genes (DEGs, log2FC>0.25, adjusted 
p-value<0.05) was determined by immunohistochemistry, and their expression in 
primary normal and CKD renal vascular endothelial cells (RECs) was modulated 
(siRNA) in vitro.
RESULTS: A total of 52,213 nuclei were analyzed. Thirty clusters were identified 
and filtered by canonical gene markers, revealing 16 unique renal cell types. 
Endothelial cells were the top cell type exhibiting the highest number of DEGs; 
which were subsequently filtered by angiogenesis-, inflammation-, and fibrosis 
(major injurious pathways altered in CKD kidneys). Venn diagram analysis 
identified 5 unique overlapping DEGs in endothelial cells: VWF, LAMA3, and KDR 
upregulated, and PTGIS and ICAM1 downregulated in CKD versus normal kidneys. 
Venn diagram analysis indicates that VWF, LAMA3, and ICAM1 participate in 
inflammatory and fibrotic signaling. Renal protein expression of these DEGs 
matched snRNA-seq findings. Furthermore, in vitro silencing of VWF and LAMA3 
ameliorated endothelial cell inflammatory and fibrotic signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work characterized the single-nuclear renal cell transcriptomic 
landscape of a translational model of CKD and singled out genes implicated in 
major renal injury pathways. These genes could serve as potential targets to 
pave the way for new therapeutic strategies in patients with CKD.

INTRODUCTION: Ketamine administered in sub-dissociative doses has been effective 
in managing a variety of painful conditions in the emergency department (ED) and 
pre-hospital settings. The inhalation route of ketamine administration has 
gained traction over the past 5 years.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the 
analgesic efficacy and incidence of adverse effects of nebulized ketamine. We 
searched Ovid CENTRAL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE databases for randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) and observational studies from inception to January 2025, 
assessing pain reduction, rescue analgesia, and occurrences of adverse effects. 
We used the Cochrane Collaboration tool and a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to 
evaluate the risk of bias and the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation) to evaluate the confidence in the 
evidence. Mean differences with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) using random 
effects were used for the meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Nebulized ketamine had 
equivalent efficacy to active controls in 8 RCT's. Four RCTs (n = 601) 
demonstrated no difference in pain reduction between nebulized ketamine and IV 
morphine with mean difference (MD) 0.28 (CI -0.18 to 0.73) at 30 min, and 
similar rates of rescue analgesia (16.9 % vs. 17.4 %). Eleven studies reported 
absence of serious events and no difference in non-serious adverse events 
(39.1 % ketamine and 37.8 % controls). The level of confidence for the outcomes 
was deemed to be very low.
CONCLUSION: Administration of ketamine via nebulization for patients with acute 
painful conditions provided equivalent analgesia with similar safety profile 
when compared to active controls.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to develop a deep learning model for 
automated pituitary adenoma segmentation in MRI scans for stereotactic 
radiosurgery planning and to assess its accuracy and efficiency in clinical 
settings.
METHODS: An nnU-Net-based model was trained on MRI scans with expert 
segmentations of 582 patients treated with Leksell Gamma Knife over the course 
of 12 years. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by a human expert on a 
separate dataset of 146 previously unseen patients. The primary outcome was the 
comparison of expert ratings between the predicted segmentations and a control 
group consisting of original manual segmentations. Secondary outcomes were the 
influence of tumor volume, previous surgery, previous stereotactic radiosurgery 
(SRS), and endocrinological status on expert ratings, performance in a subgroup 
of nonfunctioning macroadenomas (measuring 1000-4000 mm3) without previous 
surgery and/or radiosurgery, and influence of using additional MRI modalities as 
model input and time cost reduction.
RESULTS: The model achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 82.3%, 63.9%, and 
79.6% for tumor, normal gland, and optic nerve, respectively. A human expert 
rated 20.6% of the segmentations as applicable in treatment planning without any 
modifications, 52.7% as applicable with minor manual modifications, and 26.7% as 
inapplicable. The ratings for predicted segmentations were lower than for the 
control group of original segmentations (p < 0.001). Larger tumor volume, 
history of a previous radiosurgery, and nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma were 
associated with better expert ratings (p = 0.005, p = 0.007, and p < 0.001, 
respectively). In the subgroup without previous surgery, although expert ratings 
were more favorable, the association did not reach statistical significance (p = 
0.074). In the subgroup of noncomplex cases (n = 9), 55.6% of the segmentations 
were rated as applicable without any manual modifications and no segmentations 
were rated as inapplicable. Manually improving inaccurate segmentations instead 
of creating them from scratch led to 53.6% reduction of the time cost (p < 
0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The results were applicable for treatment planning with either no 
or minor manual modifications, demonstrating a significant increase in the 
efficiency of the planning process. The predicted segmentations can be loaded 
into the planning software used in clinical practice for treatment planning. The 
authors discuss some considerations of the clinical utility of the automated 
segmentation models, as well as their integration within established clinical 
workflows, and outline directions for future research.

BACKGROUND: We observed significant gains in appendicular lean mass (ALM) over 
the first 6 months of left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support for patients 
with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We sought to 
determine whether improved HF neurohumoral stability, inflammation, physical 
activity, or nutrition, are most closely related to this muscle mass recovery.
METHODS: We prospectively recruited 30 adults with HFrEF ±21 days from LVAD 
implantation. Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measured ALM at baseline and at 3- 
and 6-months post-LVAD implantation (n = 22 with ALM at baseline and 3 months). 
Markers of neurohumoral HF stability (NT-proBNP, growth differentiation 
factor-15), inflammation [high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)], habitual 
physical activity (24-hour average steps), and nutritional intake (24-hour 
average dietary protein) were also recorded. Mixed effects models separately 
evaluated the change in each parameter over time and relationships with the 
change in ALM.
RESULTS: At baseline, participants (87% male, mean age 56 ± 12 years) showed a 
significant negative association between ALM and log N-terminal-pro B 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (r = -0.38, 95% CI -0.66, -0.001, p = 0.050) and 
log growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) (r = -0.42, 95% CI -0.69, -0.05, 
p = 0.027). Over the 6-month study period, NT-proBNP and hsCRP decreased, 
24-hour steps increased, whereas GDF-15 and 24-hour dietary protein were 
unchanged. There was an increase in ALM across study timepoints, which was 
significantly associated only with reductions in log NT-proBNP and hsCRP on 
mixed effects models.
CONCLUSIONS: The recovery in ALM over the first 6 months of LVAD support was 
most closely associated with improved HF neurohumoral stability and 
inflammation, rather than activity or nutritional changes.

BACKGROUND: Chronic stress is a risk factor for depression and may contribute to 
treatment resistance. This historical cohort study examined the association 
between baseline perceived stress, measured with the Perceived Stress Scale 
(PSS), and response to (es) ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).
METHOD: Adult TRD patients who received intravenous racemic ketamine or 
intranasal esketamine were included. Depression symptoms were evaluated using 
the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR). Baseline 
stress was assessed using the PSS, with scores categorized into low to moderate 
(PSS < 27) and high (PSS ≥ 27) stress. Statistical tests, including Pearson 
correlation, Fisher's exact test, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, were used to explore 
associations between baseline stress, remission (QIDS-SR ≤ 5), and the number of 
treatments required for remission. Firth's logistic regression model estimated 
odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence interval (CI).
RESULTS: Among 39 patients (median age 47, 61.5 % female), 66.7 % had high 
perceived stress. Patients with high PSS scores required more treatments for 
remission (median = 3 vs. 1, p = 0.04). Each 5-point PSS increase reduced 
remission odds by 60 % (OR = 0.40, 95 % CI: 0.14-0.81, p = 0.009), adjusting for 
stimulant use. Notably, these effects were independent of baseline depression 
severity.
LIMITATIONS: The study's observational design and lack of a placebo group limit 
the findings.
CONCLUSIONS: TRD patients with high baseline perceived stress had lower odds of 
remission, and required more treatments to achieve remission. Further research 
should investigate whether stress-reduction strategies combined with ketamine 
could enhance treatment outcomes and whether responses differ between acute and 
chronic perceived stress.

BACKGROUND: Disease-causative variants in LMNA-encoded lamin A/C cause a genetic 
cardiomyopathy characterized by atrioventricular block, atrial fibrillation, 
ventricular arrhythmias, and systolic dysfunction. The influence of LMNA variant 
type/localization on late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) patterns and clinical 
outcomes remains unclear.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 822 genotype-positive patients with 
arrhythmogenic/dilated cardiomyopathy was used to identify those with 
disease-causative variants in LMNA. Data on LGE distribution and prevalence of 
advanced heart failure, thromboembolic and sudden cardiac death/major 
ventricular arrhythmia events were extracted from the electronic record and 
analyzed by variant type/localization.
RESULTS: Among the 72/116 (62%) LMNA variant-positive patients with cardiac 
magnetic resonance imaging data, LGE was observed in 40/72 (56%) cases. Most 
exhibited a nonischemic, midmyocardial or subepicardial pattern (73%), and 6/40 
(15%) showed a unique "pseudo-infarct" transmural pattern, predominantly 
affecting the apical segments. All 6 patients with this distinct LGE pattern 
harbored C-terminal IgD (immunoglobulin-like domain) variants (p.Arg471His or 
p.Arg541His). In patients with clinically manifest disease (76/116), those with 
IgD-localizing variants had a lower prevalence of atrioventricular block (25% 
versus 72%, P=0.002) and atrial fibrillation (50% versus 81%, P=0.019) but 
higher rates of thromboembolic events (42% versus 16%, P=0.038). During a median 
follow-up of 37 months, IgD variant presence independently predicted sudden 
cardiac death/major ventricular arrhythmia (hazard ratio, 2.391 [95% CI, 
1.046-5.464]; P=0.039).
CONCLUSIONS: LMNA missense variants localizing to IgD present a distinct apical 
pseudo-infarct LGE pattern associated with increased risk of ventricular 
arrhythmias and thromboembolic events but reduced atrioventricular block and 
atrial fibrillation. Multicenter studies are warranted to develop 
variant-specific risk-stratification strategies in cardiac laminopathy.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the lymphatic-specific morbidity (specifically, lower 
extremity lymphedema) associated with laparoscopic management of early-stage 
endometrial cancer using the sentinel lymph node (SLN) algorithm by type of 
actual nodal assessment.
METHODS: An ambispective study was conducted on consecutive patients surgically 
treated for apparent early-stage endometrial cancer who underwent laparoscopic 
staging according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network SLN algorithm at 
a single institution from January 2020 to August 2023. Data on patient 
characteristics, surgical details, and post-operative complications were 
collected. Lymphedema screening was performed using a validated questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 239 patients were analyzed, with a questionnaire response 
rate of 85.4%. The study population was grouped based on actual surgical 
staging: hysterectomy+SLN (54.8%), hysterectomy+systematic pelvic 
lymphadenectomy (27.2%), and hysterectomy only (18%). The prevalence of 
lymphedema was significantly lower in the hysterectomy+SLN group compared with 
the hysterectomy+systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy group (21.4% vs 44.6%, 
p=0.003). Multivariable analysis showed a threefold increase in the risk of 
lymphedema for the hysterectomy+systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy group compared 
with the hysterectomy+SLN group: OR 3.11 (95% CI 1.47 to 6.58). No significant 
associations were found between lymphedema and other patient or tumor 
characteristics.
CONCLUSION: In the setting of a laparoscopic approach for early-stage 
endometrial cancer surgery, SLN mapping is associated with a significant 
reduction in lymphatic complications compared with a systematic lymph node 
dissection. Our findings provide additional evidence endorsing the adoption of 
SLN mapping during minimally invasive surgery for endometrial cancer. This 
technique ensures comparable diagnostic accuracy and also minimizes 
complications.

BACKGROUND: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is common in antineutrophil 
cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), with usual interstitial 
pneumonia (UIP) being the most frequent pattern. The impact of different ILD 
patterns on clinical outcomes remains unclear.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study included patients with AAV (MPA and GPA) and 
ILD confirmed by chest CT scans between 1997 and 2021. ILD patterns were 
classified according to 2018 Fleischner Society criteria.
RESULTS: Of 1862 patients in the Mayo AAV Cohort, 143 (7.7 %) had ILD on chest 
CT. The median age at the time of ILD diagnosis (occurring before AAV diagnosis 
in 26.6 %) was 69 years (IQR 61-75); 60 % were male, and 75 % were MPO-positive. 
On chest CT, "typical UIP" pattern was identified in 44 patients (30.8 %), 
whereas 13 (9.1 %) manifested "probable UIP" pattern, 37 (25.9 %) "indeterminate 
for UIP" pattern, and 49 (34.3 %) "non-UIP" pattern. Among MPO-ANCA patients, 
typical UIP pattern was most common (37.4 %), while non-UIP pattern was most 
common (58.3 %) among PR3-ANCA patients. Patients with typical UIP pattern, when 
compared to those with non-UIP pattern, were more commonly male (70.5 %), 
MPO-ANCA (90.0 %), diagnosed before the onset of AAV (40.9 %), and had reduced 
diffusion capacity on pulmonary function tests. The presence of typical UIP was 
related with higher survival at 12 months and 10 years in MPO-ANCA patients when 
compared to other ILD patterns (IRR 8.201 and IRR 2.179).
CONCLUSIONS: The typical UIP pattern in AAV-ILD is associated with better 
survival, particularly in MPO-ANCA patients, suggesting distinct mechanisms for 
ILD development in MPO vs. PR3-AAV.

OBJECTIVE: The role of adjuvant radiotherapy after radical surgery for 
early-stage cervical cancer is controversial in the absence of high-risk 
factors. This study aimed to evaluate predictors of recurrence in patients with 
early-stage cervical cancer undergoing observation after radical surgery.
METHODS: Patients with FIGO 2018 stage I cervical cancer who underwent radical 
surgery without adjuvant therapy at the European Institute of Oncology, IEO 
(Milan, Italy) between 2010 and 2023 were retrospectively identified. Patients 
with high-risk factors for recurrence (positive margins, parametria, or lymph 
nodes) were excluded. Recurrence-free survival following surgery was estimated 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test and Cox regression analyses were 
performed to assess predictors of recurrence.
RESULTS: A total of 340 patients were identified: 7 (2.0 %) stage IA1, 31 
(9.1 %) IA2, 191 (56.2 %) IB1, 108 (31.8 %) IB2, and 3 (0.9 %) IB3. Twenty-two 
(6.5 %) patients had a recurrence. The estimated 5-year recurrence-free survival 
for the overall cohort was 93.5 % (95 % CI, 89.9-95.8). On multivariate 
analysis, factors associated with a higher risk of recurrence included tumor 
size ≥2 cm (HR 3.04, 95 % CI 1.26-7.35; p = 0.01) and grade 3 (HR 2.76, 95 % CI 
1.1-6.9; p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: In the absence of high-risk factors, the risk of recurrence in 
patients with early-stage cervical cancer who did not receive adjuvant treatment 
after radical surgery was low overall. Patients with individual risk factors 
such as tumor size ≥2 cm or tumor grade 3 may be at higher risk of recurrence. 
Further research is warranted to redefine risk groups and tailor adjuvant 
treatment based on timely clinicopathological risk factors.

BACKGROUND: Native and periprosthetic joint infections are devastating 
conditions fraught with patient morbidity and mortality. Aseptic and septic 
joints are often debrided and irrigated to decrease bacterial loads when 
preventing or treating infection. However, the effect of clinically used 
irrigation solutions on the native cellular components of the synovial joint is 
unknown.
METHODS: Patients consented, and their suprapatellar knee tissue was surgically 
excised for fibroblast isolation. Cultured knee fibroblasts were treated with 
normal saline for three minutes or one of the following experimental solutions: 
acetic acid, chlorhexidine-gluconate, Dakin's solution, hydrogen peroxide, or 
povidone-iodine. The exposure time for the antiseptic solutions was one and 
three minutes. At 24 hours after irrigation treatment, metabolic activity was 
measured via MTS 
[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] 
activity assay, and deoxyribonucleic acid content was assessed by Hoechst 
staining as a surrogate for cell number. Phase-contrast imaging elucidated 
proliferation potential, progressive cell loss, and cell morphology over a 5-day 
period. All experiments were repeated in triplicate.
RESULTS: All experimental antiseptic irrigation solutions, regardless of 
application time, caused a significant reduction in metabolic activity and DNA 
content, indicating extensive cell death. Phase-contrast imaging showed halted 
cellular proliferation, progressive cell loss, and distinct changes in cellular 
morphology, indicating decreased cellular viability and progressive cell death.
CONCLUSIONS: All antiseptic irrigation solutions investigated in this study were 
severely cytotoxic to human knee fibroblasts regardless of their chemical 
composition. The concentrations of these solutions are commonly used in 
orthopaedic surgery. Although these solutions have high bactericidal properties, 
it may be beneficial to use them in combination at lower doses to retain their 
effect on bacteria while remaining benign to native synovial cells.

TOPIC: To compare the relative risk of retinal detachment between patients with 
COL2A1 and COL11A1 Stickler syndrome.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: It is unclear whether the rate of retinal detachment differs 
between COL2A1 and COL11A1 Stickler syndrome. Previous studies included too few 
patients to detect a difference between genotypes.
METHODS: Individual patient data meta-analysis of cohort studies, case-control 
studies, cross-sectional studies, case series, and case reports across the 
MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and Web of Science 
Preprint Citation Index databases from 1991 to 2025. Articles providing eye 
examination results in subjects with genetically confirmed COL2A1 or COL11A1 
Stickler syndrome were included. From the included articles, individual patient 
data on affected gene, age at last follow-up, and presence or absence of retinal 
detachment were extracted. Patients who had prophylactic retinopexy were 
excluded. A mixed effects logistic regression adjusted for clustering by article 
and by family was used to determine the relative risk of retinal detachment. 
Risk of bias was evaluated using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case 
Series. The study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023428144). 
Overall certainty of evidence was evaluated with Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation.
RESULTS: Of the 1420 articles screened, 179 were eligible for inclusion and 141 
provided individual patient data for a total of 673 patients from 430 families. 
Retinal detachment was present in 229 of 491 (47%) COL2A1 Stickler syndrome 
patients and in 51 of 182 (28%) COL11A1 Stickler syndrome patients. The relative 
risk of retinal detachment was 1.78 times higher in COL2A1 compared to COL11A1 
Stickler syndrome (95% CI: 1.30-2.43 p < 0.001). The certainty of evidence was 
moderate.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate a higher risk of retinal detachment in COL2A1 
compared to COL11A1 Stickler syndrome, which may aid clinicians in determining 
individualized management plans for patients with Stickler syndrome. However, 
due to reporting biases inherent to the case series and case reports from which 
we obtained data, the overall certainty of evidence was rated as moderate and 
our analysis was limited to providing relative risk of retinal detachment, not 
absolute risk.

BACKGROUND: Proximal pole scaphoid fracture nonunions are challenging conditions 
to treat. When significant comminution of the proximal pole and avascular 
necrosis is present, scaphoid proximal pole reconstructive options are 
considered. The proximal pole of the hamate is a local autograft option; 
however, little has been described on the outcomes of this procedure.
METHODS: Patients who underwent proximal pole scaphoid reconstruction using 
proximal hamate autograft at 3 tertiary care centers were retrospectively 
reviewed. Radiographic union was classified by greater than 50% bony trabeculae 
across the reconstruction site on computed tomography scan.
RESULTS: Ten patients were included. Average age at the time of surgery was 27.9 
years, and 60% were men. Average length of proximal hamate autograft harvested 
was 10 mm. All patients healed at an average of 14.3 weeks following surgery. At 
final follow-up, 3 patients reported no pain, 3 reported mild occasional pain, 2 
reported moderate tolerable pain (1 at the hamate graft site), and 2 had no 
reports on their pain level.
CONCLUSIONS: In small proximal pole scaphoid nonunions with fragmentation and 
avascular necrosis, ipsilateral proximal hamate autograft reconstruction of the 
scaphoid proximal pole is a viable and reproducible option with high rates of 
union and patient satisfaction.

Flexor Pollicis Longus Palsy Following Both-Bone Forearm Fracture Fixation: A 
Case-Based and Cadaveric Evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Flexor pollicis longus (FPL) palsy following both-bone forearm 
fracture (BBFF) is a rare complication.
METHODS: A retrospective review of acute BBFF treated with open reduction 
internal fixation by a single surgeon from 2005 to 2023 was performed. Injury 
and surgical characteristics of patients with documented FPL palsy were 
reviewed. In addition, 10 cadaveric dissections were performed to evaluate the 
anatomy of the anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) and its branches. The distance 
of these branches from palpable elbow landmarks and variability in branching 
pattern were evaluated.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients underwent surgery for acute BBFF. Of these, 5 
(17%) had evidence of an FPL palsy either at the time of injury presentation (n 
= 2) or immediately following surgery (n = 3). All patients with FPL palsy 
sustained fractures in the middle one-third of the radius. All palsies resolved 
after an average of 33 days of observation. In cadaveric dissections, the 
average distance from the lateral epicondyle to the AIN takeoff and branch to 
the FPL was 5.5 and 7.6 cm, respectively. The AIN takeoff and branch to the FPL 
were never less than 4 and 7 cm from the lateral epicondyle, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Flexor pollicis longus palsy following BBFF can occur at the time of 
injury or following surgery. All FPL palsies involved midshaft radial fractures 
and were likely neurapraxia. The etiology of FPL palsy remains unclear, but 
cadaveric dissection suggests the FPL motor branch may be at risk from 
mid-to-proximal radius fracture fragments or excessive traction during surgery.

Pharmacogenomics (PGx) has the potential to improve prescribing practices. In 
2012, our institution developed a multidisciplinary program to implement PGx-CDS 
to support the clinical practice. CDS has been implemented for 45 drug-gene 
interactions, in 42,000 patients with PGx tests results, and in 2023, 
approximately 9281 CDS interventions have triggered at the time of prescribing.

Background  Cadaveric dissection remains a preferred and irreplaceable learning 
modality among neurosurgery residents. We aimed to develop and describe a 
tiered, quantifiable, and practical curriculum for cranial neurosurgical anatomy 
education. We report the structure and evaluation of our 2-year pilot study to 
serve as a suggested guide for other neurosurgery programs. Methods  Our Complex 
Cranial Dissection Program is tailored to the needs of junior-level neurosurgery 
residents based on their postgraduation years 1 to 4. Dissections are performed 
in a sequential manner, each of which emphasize a particular set of manual 
skills and neuroanatomical knowledge. Dissections are scored on a scale of 10 
points. The grading was based on specific landmarks and anatomical structures, 
which need to be exposed, explored, and preserved. Results  Out of 16 residents, 
14 individuals (87.5%) attended the dissections in the first iteration of the 
program and 16 individuals (100%) attended the dissections in the second 
iteration. A total of 17 dissections were performed across all years. In survey 
feedback about the program, 100% (Year 1) and 94% (Year 2) of residents 
considered the assigned dissections to be appropriate for their respective 
training levels. Further, 100% (Year 1) and 94% (Year 2) of residents endorsed 
that the dissections were important and helpful for their practice prior to 
similar operating room experiences. Conclusion  The development and 
implementation of structured dissection programs within residency training, 
along with dedicated staff, and objective feedback serve a crucial role in 
neurosurgical education to further develop and enhance surgical skills in the 
operative setting.

BACKGROUND: Literature is inconsistent with respect to clinical value of 
lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) semiquantitative assessment. We aim to 
investigate the prognostic role of LVSI extent in stage I endometrioid 
endometrial carcinomas (ECs) classified by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis.
METHODS: Patients with stage I endometrioid EC undergone primary surgery were 
retrospectively included. Following World Health Organization definition for 
LVSI pathologic evaluation, subjects were divided into: LVSI-negative; 
LVSI-focal; LVSI-substantial. An IHC-based model was utilized to classify 
patients into: p53-aberrant (p53abn); mismatch repair deficient (MMRd); mismatch 
repair proficient with positive estrogen receptors (MMRp-ERpos); and mismatch 
repair proficient with negative estrogen receptors (MMRp-ERneg).
RESULTS: 2091 subjects were included and divided into: 78.0 % (n:1631) 
LVSI-negative, 10.6 % (n:221) LVSI-focal, and 11.4 % (n:239) LVSI-substantial. 
Presence of LVSI (any extent) was associated with older age, larger tumor size 
and deeper myometrial infiltration. Patients with LVSI-substantial presented 
with higher incidence of grade 3 tumors, p53abn and MMRd status. Conversely, 
most LVSI-negative and LVSI-focal cases were MMRp-ERpos. At multivariable 
regression, LVSI-substantial was independently associated with reduced 5-year 
disease-free survival (DFS) and overall-survival (OS). LVSI-negative and 
LVSI-focal groups had similar DFS (p = 0.42) and OS (p = 0.09), whereas 
comparison with LVSI-substantial demonstrated significantly poorer outcomes for 
patients with substantial invasion. These findings were confirmed in 
sub-analyses of cases with grade 1-2 endometrioid and myometrial infiltration, 
and in the MMRp-ERpos cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: In stage I endometrioid ECs, LVSI-focal was not associated with 
reduced oncologic outcomes compared to LVSI-negative. In contrast, 
LVSI-substantial was associated with aggressive clinicopathologic and molecular 
features and behaved as an independent prognostic factor for reduced survival. 
Our results were further confirmed in two low-risk EC settings: grade 1-2 with 
myometrial infiltration, and the MMRp-ERpos group.

Esophageal-Pericardial Fistula: A Systematic Review of Etiology, Diagnostic 
Features, Management, and Outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Esophageal-pericardial fistula (EPF) is rare with an incidence of 
0.016%-0.04%. With novel procedures involving intracardiac or esophageal 
instrumentation in the last few decades, including atrial fibrillation (AF) 
ablation, further understanding of this unique entity is warranted. In this 
systematic review, we summarize the etiology, diagnostic features, management, 
and outcomes of EPF.
METHODS: A librarian conducted a systematic literature review of case 
reports/series describing adults diagnosed with EPF through 7 major 
databases/registries from inception to 7/30/2024.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty patients from 115 papers met the inclusion criteria. 
Median age(IQR) was 57(44-67) years, with a male predominance (73.7%). The 
primary etiology of EPF shifted from benign esophageal diseases before 2000 to 
AF ablation on/after 2000. Median time(IQR) from AF ablation to EPF 
presentation/diagnosis was 17(13-23) days. Chest pain (70.8%) and 
pneumopericardium (90.0%) were, respectively, the most common presenting symptom 
and pericardial finding. Water-soluble contrast esophagram (WSCE) had the 
highest diagnostic sensitivity (82.8%). Management included surgery (47.5%), 
stent placement (22.5%), combined surgery/stenting (19.2%), and conservative 
(10.8%). Overall mortality was 37.5%; median(IQR) time to death was 20(9-41) 
days. EPF from malignancy had poorer survival than those from benign esophageal 
causes (HR 2.65 [1.36-5.17]; p = 0.004) and cardiac ablation (HR 5.74 
[2.41-13.65]; p < 0.0001). Patients who received any intervention (HR 0.28 
[0.13-0.57]; p = 0.0005) or had confirmed EPF resolution (HR 0.27 [0.12-0.59]; 
p = 0.0009) demonstrated better survival. There was no difference in survival 
between surgery and stenting alone (p = 0.91).
CONCLUSIONS: AF ablation is now the leading etiology of EPF. Given its high 
mortality, a high degree of clinical suspicion is essential in those presenting 
with key signs/symptoms following AF ablation to enable urgent diagnosis and 
multi-disciplinary management. WSCE may be the diagnostic modality to perform, 
given its high sensitivity. Future studies are warranted to investigate whether 
stenting should be the primary management given possible non-inferiority to 
surgery.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 10% of patients report penicillin allergy. Based on 
historical guidelines, patients with a penicillin allergy should receive an 
alternative to cephalexin for prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery.
OBJECTIVE: To determine, based on evidence, if cephalexin should be used as a 
first-line prophylactic antibiotic in dermatologic surgery for patients with 
penicillin allergy.
METHODS: Systematic review of the literature was performed with defined search 
terms.
RESULTS: Less than 5% of those with penicillin allergy labels have a true 
penicillin allergy. For patients with true, persistent penicillin allergy, there 
is an overall low cross-reactivity with cephalosporins, especially with 
cephalosporins that do not share identical R1 side chain. The first-generation 
cephalosporins, including cephalexin, have a slightly higher risk of 
cross-reactivity in patients with reported allergy to amino-penicillins 
(amoxicillin, ampicillin) but not other penicillins. The risk of severe 
cross-reactivity of cephalosporins in patients with low-risk penicillin 
allergies is extremely low. Cephalexin has a superior side effect profile and 
efficacy compared to alternatives.
CONCLUSION: Cephalexin should be used as the first-line prophylactic antibiotic 
in dermatologic surgery for patients with documented penicillin allergy, 
including anaphylaxis. There may be a higher risk of cross-reactivity with 
cephalexin in patients with a confirmed amino-penicillin allergy.

This review addresses selected topics in gastroenterology and hepatology that 
are of interest and relevance to general internists. The topics were selected on 
the basis of publications in 2024 in top general medicine journals (New England 
Journal of Medicine, Journal of the American Medical Association, Annals of 
Internal Medicine, Lancet), often complemented with publications in the top 
gastroenterology journals pertaining to the same themes. General internists may 
be the primary providers for some of these diseases or the first to evaluate 
symptoms-such as uncontrolled heartburn; dysphagia, which is increasingly 
recognized as being associated with allergic mechanisms including eosinophil 
infiltration of the esophagus; irritable bowel syndrome; and the effects of 
incretin therapies (glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucagon-dependent 
insulinotropic peptide agonists) on obesity, metabolic-associated 
steatohepatitis, or steatotic liver diseases-and to screen for colorectal cancer 
by novel blood or stool markers. Alternatively, internists may provide 
continuity of care for more complex diseases, including a novel diagnostic 
approach to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, immunotherapy for locally advanced 
mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer, and treatment of rarer liver 
diseases such as primary biliary cholangitis. These topics illustrate impressive 
advances in 2024 in the diagnosis and management of diseases affecting the 
gastrointestinal tract and liver.

Telomeres are repetitive sequences at the ends of chromosomes that contribute to 
genome stability and prevent replicative senescence. Telomere biology disorders 
(TBDs) encompass a spectrum of genetic conditions characterized by accelerated 
telomere shortening, which affects different organs, including the liver. 
TBD-related hepatic manifestations are often unrecognized and can range from 
asymptomatic liver test abnormalities to steatohepatitis, hepatopulmonary 
syndrome, or cirrhotic and noncirrhotic portal hypertension requiring liver 
transplantation. This review summarizes the current literature and aims to 
describe liver involvement in TBDs, highlighting diagnostic gaps and therapeutic 
challenges.

Previous investigations demonstrated that okra polysaccharide (OP) ameliorated 
hepatocellular lipotoxicity in vitro. However, the therapeutic efficacy and 
molecular mechanisms involved in metabolic-associated fatty liver disease 
(MAFLD) require further elucidation. To address this gap, two murine models of 
MAFLD, obese Ob/Ob mice and high fat/cholesterol/fructose (HFCF) fed-mice, were 
utilized. The therapeutic implications of OP supplementation were evaluated by 
quantifying lipid-specific biomarkers and conducting hepatic histopathological 
examinations. Complementary transcriptomic, phosphoproteomic, and in vitro 
analyses were performed to unravel the molecular mechanisms. In the Ob/Ob mouse 
model, OP significantly reduced both circulating and hepatic lipid levels while 
ameliorating hepatic steatosis. In the HFCF-induced MAFLD model, OP not only 
attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation but also mitigated concurrent inflammation 
and fibrosis. Subsequent RNA-sequencing analyses on hepatic tissues from 
HFCF-diet mice revealed that OP modulated MAFLD-associated transcriptional 
signatures. A combined assessment of transcriptomics and phosphoproteomics 
highlighted OP's significant impact on the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated 
Receptor (PPAR) pathway, particularly through the upregulation of PPAR-γ 
signaling. In murine hepatocytes, OP counteracted steatosis and inflammation via 
PPAR-γ signaling activation. These effects were abolished upon administration of 
the PPAR-γ-specific antagonist GW9662. Collectively, our empirical evidence 
provides the inaugural demonstration that OP mitigates MAFLD pathology through 
the activation of PPAR-γ signaling, presenting a novel therapeutic avenue for 
MAFLD intervention.

Previous research has explored Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) 
interventions for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. However, the optimal dose 
parameters for TMS interventions targeting suicidal ideation in adolescents 
remain unknown. This exploratory study examined the impact of 1 Hz and 10 Hz TMS 
treatment on suicidal ideation in adolescents with major depressive disorder. 
Participants (N = 41) aged 12-18 years were randomized to TMS treatments with 
1 Hz or 10 Hz frequency over 6 weeks and included in the exploratory analyses. 
The change in the intensity of suicidal ideation throughout treatment was 
estimated with ordinal logistic regression models with and without adjustments 
for the change in depressive symptom severity. The predicted odds of intensity 
of suicidal ideation significantly decreased over six-weeks of acute TMS 
treatment for both the 10 Hz TMS group (OR = 0.754, 95 % CI = 0.634 to 0.897, 
p = 0.0015) and the 1 Hz TMS group (OR = 0.780, 95 % CI = 0.668 to 0.909, 
p = 0.0016). However, after adjustment for the change in depression severity as 
a time-varying covariate in the ordinal logistic regression model, the magnitude 
of the decrease (or predicted odds) in intensity of suicidal ideation was 
attenuated and rendered non-significant for both the 10 Hz and 1 Hz TMS groups. 
TMS treatment suicidal ideation outcomes were not significantly different 
between the 10 Hz and 1 Hz TMS groups. Low-frequency TMS may be as effective as 
high-frequency TMS in treating suicidal ideation in adolescents with depression. 
Notably, 1 Hz TMS may have a favorable tolerability and safety profile for 
adolescents.

BACKGROUND: Lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) is an effective surgical 
treatment for extremity lymphedema. Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescent 
lymphography, the traditional standard for imaging lymphatic vessels, has 
limitations, including difficulty depicting deeper or congested lymphatics and 
contraindication in iodine hypersensitivity. This study evaluated 
contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with microbubbles for identifying lymphatic 
vessels for LVA and compared it with ICG lymphography.
METHODS: In this single-center retrospective review, intraoperative CEUS with 
intradermal injection of microbubble suspension (Lumason, Bracco Diagnostics, 
Inc.) was used in patients before LVA surgery between October 2019 and February 
2023. Pre- or intraoperative ICG lymphography was also used to identify target 
lymphatic vessels. All patients diagnosed with primary or secondary extremity 
lymphedema who underwent LVA were included. Technical success rate was defined 
as lymphatic vessels identified by CEUS that led to successful LVAs. Descriptive 
statistics were used.
RESULTS: Thirty-two patients underwent LVA surgery, with a mean age of 
58.5 ± 13.9 years. CEUS identified lymphatic vessels in all 32 patients, 
including 7 in whom ICG failed. Two patients with ICG allergy underwent CEUS 
only. CEUS identified more candidate lymphatics per patient (5.3 ± 4.2) compared 
with ICG (2.5 ± 2.7). Of the 182 anastomoses, 96 (52.8%) were identified by both 
CEUS and ICG, 75 (41.2%) by CEUS only, and 11 (6%) by ICG only.
CONCLUSIONS: CEUS is a promising tool for identifying lymphatic vessels in 
patients with lymphedema undergoing LVA, particularly when ICG lymphography is 
inadequate or contraindicated.

This phase II trial of transoral surgery (TOS) with deintensified postoperative 
management in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharynx cancer (OPC) 
enrolled patients with resectable cT1-2 stage III/IV American Joint Committee on 
Cancer (AJCC) seventh edition p16+ OPC without matted neck nodes. Those with 
clear margins, 0-1 + nodes (LN), and no extranodal extension (ENE) were observed 
(arm A); those with clear margins, 2-4 + LN, or ENE ≤1 mm were randomly assigned 
to 50 Gy (arm B) or 60 Gy (arm C); and those with involved margins, >4 + LN, or 
>1 mm ENE received weekly cisplatin and 60-66 Gy (arm D). Among 359 evaluable 
patients, the 54-month progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 
90.6% (90% CI, 87.2% to 93.1%) and 95.3% (93.0% to 96.9%), respectively. The 
54-month PFS by arm was A 93.2% (79.6% to 97.8%; all four recurrences among N1 
patients), B 94.9% (89.7% to 97.5%), C 90.2% (82.7% to 94.6%), and D 85.5% 
(77.5% to 90.8%). The 54-month OS by arm was A 97.1% (85.7% to 99.4%), B 97.9% 
(93.5% to 99.3%), C 95.1% (90.1% to 97.6%), and D 92.5% (86.9% to 95.7%). PFS or 
OS did not differ by primary site or smoking history. TOS and neck dissection 
with deintensified postoperative management results in outstanding 54-month PFS 
and OS. Among patients with favorable pathologic characteristics, those with N1 
disease are at risk of late recurrence without radiation.

PURPOSE: Over 50% of households in the United States have at least one 
musician-many musicians are also breast cancer survivors. This group has not 
been well studied, and given the level of fine sensory-motor skill required for 
musicianship, we hypothesized that musicians experience unique manifestations of 
breast cancer treatment toxicities.
METHODS: A nine-item Musical Toxicity Questionnaire (MTQ) was distributed to 
patients who had consented to participate in the Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer 
Registry. The MTQ screened participants by asking if they played a musical 
instrument or sang in the last 10 years: questions populated for those who 
answered yes. Respondents were asked if they noticed difficulty with their 
musical endeavor during or after breast cancer treatment, defined as acute 
musical toxicity (AMT). The questionnaire asked which side effect and 
cancer-directed therapy most influenced musical ability, what musical attributes 
were affected, and the timeline of resolution. Multivariable and classification 
tree analyses assessed relationships between AMT and treatment characteristics.
RESULTS: Of 1,871 survey respondents, 29% (535/1,871) self-identified as 
musicians. Over a quarter (27%, 144/535) reported AMT, and for 57% (82/144), AMT 
had not resolved at the time of survey. Of the treatments each participant 
received, chemotherapy was most often reported as most negatively impactful 
(63/89 who received chemotherapy, 71%). Decreased endurance was the most common 
musical difficulty (64% of those with AMT, 92/144), followed by decreased 
accuracy, trouble playing/singing quickly, and difficulty using proper 
technique. Multivariable and classification tree analyses revealed that receipt 
of chemotherapy was most strongly correlated with AMT.
CONCLUSION: These results will help oncology care teams counsel musicians, 
answer questions about impacts on musicality, and provide a timeline for 
resolution of musical symptoms.

Hemorrhagic, omental-containing inguinal hernia is a very rare cause of acute 
scrotum in the pediatric population. Here, we describe the case of a 4-year-old 
boy who presented with acute scrotal swelling and pain. Scrotal ultrasound was 
used to identify a left indirect inguinal hernia with contents suggestive of 
inflamed fat and hemorrhagic debris. Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair and 
subsequent pathological evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of left indirect 
inguinal hernia with incarcerated omentum and hemorrhagic ascites. Given the 
variability of herniated structures in pediatric patients of different ages and 
sexes, appropriate recognition of hernia contents by ultrasonography is 
essential for reducing additional imaging studies and accelerating treatment.

BACKGROUND: Minimum joint space width (mJSW) is a useful quantitative metric of 
osteoarthritis progression in the hip, particularly as a continuous variable 
compared to more common categorical classification systems. The purpose of this 
study was to develop an automated algorithm for measuring mJSW in native hips on 
antero-posterior (AP) pelvis radiographs.
METHODS: An end-to-end algorithm was developed, consisting of a deep learning 
segmentation model plus a computer vision algorithm to measure mJSW in the hip 
joint. Trained researchers annotated 300 radiographs for training and validation 
of an automated segmentation model that identifies relevant structures for the 
measurement of mJSW. Trained annotators also independently measured mJSW in 375 
additional images to provide ground truth measurements for the development and 
validation of a computer vision algorithm. External validation was performed on 
75 images from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). Algorithm performance was 
measured by calculating the mean absolute error and constructing a Bland-Altman 
plot.
RESULTS: The mean absolute error between the human and the algorithm's 
measurements was 0.87 ± 1.05 mm. In 70% of cases, the algorithm's mJSW 
measurements were less than one mm different from human measurements, in 84% the 
difference was less than 1.5 mm, and in 90% the difference was less than two mm. 
In the OAI external validation cohort, mean absolute error was 0.86 ± 0.69 mm. 
The trained segmentation model obtained an average Dice score of 0.71 across all 
structures in the test set.
CONCLUSION: An automated model for measuring mJSW on AP pelvis radiographs was 
developed and externally validated. This algorithm performs well at the 
sub-millimeter level and may streamline longitudinal patient evaluation and 
population-level clinical research in the natural history of the hip joint.

BACKGROUND: Investigation of circulating plasma proteins may reveal insights 
into molecular pathways that contribute to the development of heart failure (HF) 
among people with chronic kidney disease.
OBJECTIVES: The authors aimed to identify circulating kidney function-related 
plasma proteins that are associated with the risk of incident HF.
METHODS: The authors studied participants of the ongoing longitudinal ARIC 
(Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) study. Relative plasma concentrations of 
4,697 unique proteins were measured with the use of an aptamer assay 
(Somalogic). Each protein was tested for associations with estimated glomerular 
filtration rate (eGFR), log-transformed urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio 
(UACR), and incident HF by means of multivariable linear and Cox regression 
models. Protein-HF associations were validated externally in the CRIC (Chronic 
Renal Insufficiency Cohort) study. Two-sample mendelian randomization was used 
to test for potential causal associations.
RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, 44 plasma proteins were associated with 
either eGFR or UACR and incident HF at 2 separate ARIC study visits, of which 29 
were validated externally in CRIC. Most plasma proteins were associated with HF 
with preserved ejection fraction, but not reduced ejection fraction. A cluster 
within these 44 plasma proteins were associated with larger left ventricular 
end-diastolic volume index and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. Mendelian 
randomization suggests that Golgi membrane protein 1 is causally associated with 
HF and eGFR.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified 44 eGFR- and UACR-related plasma proteins 
that are associated with incident HF independently from demographics, risk 
factors, and kidney function. These results may inform future therapeutic and 
biomarker development for the prevention and treatment of incident HF.

BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) treatment guidelines 
suggest varied approaches for patients with first (frCDI) or multiply recurrent 
CDI (mrCDI). Low microbial diversity, elevated primary bile acids (BA), and low 
secondary BA concentrations favor germination of C. difficile spores into 
toxin-producing bacteria and are believed to increase rCDI risk. Greater 
understanding of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome in rCDI may inform 
management of the disease. We describe a post hoc comparison of GI microbiome 
and bile acid profiles between patients with frCDI and mrCDI in a Phase 3 
open-label trial, ECOSPOR IV, of fecal microbiota spores, live-brpk (VOWST®; 
VOS, formerly SER-109), an orally-administered live microbiome therapeutic.
METHODS: Patients received VOS following symptom resolution after 
standard-of-care antibiotics. Pre-treatment baseline (within 3 days following 
antibiotic completion) and week 1 post-dosing stool samples were collected for 
whole metagenomic sequencing and metabolomics. Diversity was calculated from 
MetaPhlAn2 species profiles. Concentrations of primary and secondary BAs were 
measured via targeted LC-MS/MS.
RESULTS: rCDI rates through week 8 were similarly low in both frCDI and mrCDI 
patients (6.5% vs. 9.7%, respectively). Baseline microbial diversity was 
similarly low between frCDI and mrCDI subgroups (p>0.05). Diversity and 
secondary BA concentrations increased in both subgroups, whereas primary BA 
concentrations declined following VOS dosing, leading to few differences between 
subgroups at Week 1.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest commonalities in microbiome disruption in 
patients with frCDI and mrCDI that contribute to recurrence and suggest that 
antibiotics followed by a live microbiome therapy may be an optimal treatment 
strategy for rCDI, regardless of number of prior CDI recurrences.

BACKGROUND: Compared to Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonian disorders 
(APD) are characterized by a more rapidly progressive course, often leading to 
profound disability. Effective communication between clinicians, patients, and 
care partners is essential to support patient-centered care and shared 
decision-making. However, most neurologists lack formal training in serious 
illness conversations (SIC).
OBJECTIVE: To develop a practical SIC guide tailored to the needs of individuals 
with APD.
METHODS: Members of the CurePSP Centers of Care Palliative Care Working Group, 
in collaboration with a SIC education expert (TC), developed a SIC guide for 
APD. A literature review was conducted, followed by online consensus-building 
rounds.
RESULTS: Applying core communication principles-such as active listening, 
pausing, naming and validating emotions, assessing understanding, and 
reframing-can foster alignment between clinicians, patients, and their care 
partners. Navigating the balance between maintaining hope and providing 
realistic, anticipatory guidance remains challenging but best achieved by 
honest, compassionate dialogue. Four practical guides were developed, addressing 
common and often challenging scenarios: delivering an APD diagnosis, eliciting 
patient goals in the context of changing clinical status, addressing safety 
concerns, and discussing quality of life and end-of-life considerations.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients and their care partners living with APD benefit greatly 
from individualized guidance, and honest, empathic communication is a vital part 
of patient-centered care. While existing SIC frameworks offer valuable 
foundations, further research is needed to optimize their adaptation for 
APD-identifying best timing, specific frameworks, relevant outcome measures, and 
education strategies to build team-wide competency.

OBJECTIVES: A spinal cord stimulation (SCS) approach has been developed that 
uses inactive electrode contacts to record epidural spinal recordings (ESRs) 
generated during SCS. ESRs contain evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) 
which represent a quantitative measure of synchronous neural recruitment in the 
spinal cord. ECAPs may be utilized as a control signal for closed-loop 
stimulation and aid in optimal electrode placement and parameter selection. 
However, the various physiological and technical factors underlying the 
composition of these signals are difficult to obtain experimentally due to 
subject variability and sources of noise, which may limit the use of ECAPs in 
elucidating mechanisms of SCS-induced analgesia. Therefore, the goal of this 
study was to use computational modeling based on detailed anatomical imaging 
paired with preclinical physiological data to investigate the neuromodulatory 
effects of SCS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a computational model from an experimental 
data set containing imaging and ESRs from six swine. We coupled our finite 
element method model with multicompartment cable models to simulate the neural 
response to SCS. We then used a reciprocity-based approach to calculate model 
ECAP recordings.
RESULTS: Model ECAPs were dependent on stimulation parameters (ie, tonic 
stimulation waveform and configuration) and anatomical variations (ie, dorsal 
cerebrospinal fluid thickness and mediolateral lead location). Our modeling 
results indicate that the combined choice of stimulation waveform and 
stimulation configuration may result in action potential initiation at different 
locations, which, when recorded, gives rise to ECAPs with different morphologies 
and amplitudes, even for approximately the same level of underlying neural 
activation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ECAP characteristics may not directly 
represent the level of neural recruitment to a stimulus and are highly dependent 
on stimulation parameters. Overall, the results of this study provide a 
mechanistic understanding of how various factors affect the composition of ECAP 
recordings and will help optimize the utility of ESRs in SCS.

Background: Immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) via lymphovenous 
anastomosis is performed in patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection 
(ALND) to minimize the risk of lymphedema. Following ALND, drains are placed to 
prevent seromas, while prolonged drain days are associated with increased risk 
of infection. The study aim was to determine the impact of ILR on the number of 
drain days following ALND in patients with breast cancer.Methods: We report a 
post-hoc analysis of a prospective trial (April 2018-January 2023) comparing 
patients with breast cancer who underwent ALND with ILR (intervention arm) vs 
ALND without ILR (control arm). Wilcoxon rank sum test and chi-squared or 
Fisher's exact tests compared continuous and categorical variables, 
respectively. Multivariable quantile regression models evaluated the difference 
in drain days and days until drain removal criteria were met with covariates 
adjusted.Results: Data from 214 patients were analyzed (n = 115 interventional 
arm, n = 99 control arm). The intervention arm had a median of 15 axillary drain 
days compared to 11 days in the control arm (P = .001). There was no significant 
difference between groups when measuring drain days based on the date the drain 
met removal criteria, rather than actual drain removal date. Seroma incidence 
was lower in the intervention arm (3.5%) vs the control arm (12.1%) (P = .017) 
without a statistical difference in incidence of infection.Conclusion: ALND with 
ILR does not decrease the number of drain days compared to ALND without ILR in 
patients with breast cancer, although we found the incidence of seromas to be 
lower without increase in incidence of infection.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of breast, cervical, prostate, and 
colorectal cancer screening in patients with RA versus matched non-RA 
comparators.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective, matched cohort study of patients with and 
without RA living in an 8-county region of southern Minnesota on January 1, 
2015. Through review of medical records, patients who fulfilled either the 1987 
ACR or 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were identified. Patients 
with RA were matched 1:1 to non-RA comparators on age, sex, and county of 
residence. Cancer screening was determined from review of the U.S. Preventative 
Task Force recommendations. Cumulative incidence of cancer screening was 
estimated accounting for the competing risk of death, and Cox proportional 
hazard models adjusted for age, smoking and race assessed for the risk of delay.
RESULTS: The study included 1,614 patients with RA and 1,597 comparators without 
RA (mean age 63 years; 71% female). At 5-years of follow-up, 51.6% 
[95%CI:47.9-55.6%] of the RA cohort had cervical cancer screening compared to 
58.2% [95%CI:54.5-62.2%] in the non-RA cohort. After adjusting for age, smoking, 
and race, RA was associated with decreased cervical cancer screening (aHR:0.83 
[95%CI:0.72-0.96]). RA was not significantly associated with a decrease in 
breast (aHR:0.98 [95%CI:0.87-1.10]), prostate (aHR:0.99 [95%CI:0.74-1.34]), or 
colorectal (aHR:1.04 [95%CI:0.93-1.16]) cancer screening.
CONCLUSION: Women with RA were more likely to experience delayed cervical cancer 
screening. Increased diligence by healthcare providers to ensure cervical cancer 
screening in RA patients is important to reduce the morbidity and mortality seen 
in patients with RA.

OBJECTIVES: A tenet of open fracture management is timely administration of 
antibiotics to reduce risk of fracture-related infection (FRI). Trauma centers 
strive to administer intravenous antibiotics within one hour of patient arrival. 
The foundation for this recommendation is based on relatively few studies, which 
base their findings on time from hospital arrival to antibiotic administration. 
Little attention has been paid to the prehospital time course of open fracture 
patients. We hypothesized that a significant portion of open fracture patients 
arrive at the hospital greater than one hour after their injury, which would 
represent an opportunity for improved care.
METHODS: Design: Retrospective Case Series Setting: Urban/Suburban Academic 
Level I Trauma Center Patient Selection Criteria: Subjects were identified using 
a retrospective search for open fracture patients arriving via emergency medical 
services (EMS). Patients were included if they were age 18 or greater, presented 
with an open fracture, and had complete pre-hospital documentation, in-hospital 
documentation, and radiographs. Outcome Measures and Comparisons: Data collected 
included patient demographics, fracture location, Gustilo-Anderson 
classification, dispatch time, on scene time, enroute to hospital time, arrival 
at hospital time, transfer of care time, modality of transport, whether 
intravenous antibiotics were administered prior to arrival at the hospital, and 
development of FRI. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the findings.
RESULTS: 454 patients met the inclusion criteria. Mean time from dispatch to 
transfer of care was 66.8 ± 26.9 min in all transports; 84.1 ± 25.6 min with 
helicopter EMS; and 64.8 ± 26.4 min with ground EMS. 239 patients (52.6 %) had 
transfer of care time greater than one hour after dispatch time. Only 3.7 % of 
open fracture patients received antibiotics prior to hospital arrival. There was 
a positive correlation with the development of FRI and prolonged pre-hospital 
time.
CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with open fractures had transfer of care more than 
one hour after dispatch. FRI was associated with increased prehospital time. 
These results suggest an opportunity for prehospital antibiotic administration 
to mitigate the risk of infection in patients with open fractures.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is 
associated with less financial toxicity (financial difficulties that patients 
experience due to treatment, such as out-of-pocket costs, transportation costs, 
and time away from work) than whole breast irradiation (WBI).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched bibliographic databases for studies published 
from database inception through April 2024. Eligible studies were randomized 
clinical trials and observational studies that evaluated financial toxicity of 
APBI or WBI treatments among adult women with early-stage breast cancer. Pairs 
of independent reviewers selected the studies.
RESULTS: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. One study using the 
comprehensive score for financial toxicity did not report a significant 
difference between APBI and WBI. Four studies using the European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 financial difficulties question 
reported greater financial difficulties with WBI when compared with APBI, with 2 
studies reporting differences within 3 months of radiotherapy and 2 studies 
reporting differences at 1-2 years. Four studies evaluated the cost of travel 
and days away from work and reported less financial impact associated with APBI 
when compared with WBI.
CONCLUSION: APBI is associated with less financial toxicity than WBI, which may 
be dependent on the shorter duration of treatment.

BACKGROUND: There is a global mismatch between the number of adults with 
congenital heart disease and adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) 
cardiologists, potentially impacting patient outcomes. This survey explores 
factors influencing trainees and cardiologists' career choices in ACHD.
METHODS: An online, anonymous global survey on demographics, ACHD as a career 
choice, encouraging and deterring factors assessed via a 5-point Likert scale 
and open-ended questions on recommending ACHD was distributed through targeted 
emails and social media. Responses meeting a 75% completion criterion were 
analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Among 811 included responses, most were from women (53.5%), aged 31 to 
40 years (48.3%), White individuals (43.3%), non-Hispanic individuals (85%), 
from outside the ACHD field (79.0%), and from North America (42.7%). Only 30.9% 
of non-ACHD physicians considered specializing in ACHD despite 78.9% 
recommending it. Encouraging factors included awareness of ACHD significance, 
mentor influence, and clinical exposure. Key deterrents were inadequate 
financial incentives, limited job opportunities, and lengthy training. Regional 
variations showed that longer training duration and lack of compensation 
incentives were the main deterrents in North America. Suggested solutions 
included structured training programs, salary improvements, and early ACHD 
exposure during medical education.
CONCLUSIONS: Less than a third of respondents considered ACHD as a career 
largely due to inadequate financial incentives, limited job opportunities, and 
long training duration. Addressing these barriers could enhance recruitment and 
help meet the growing demands of the ACHD population.

In patients treated with salvage lymph node dissection (sLND) for nodal 
recurrence of prostate cancer, whether radioguided surgery (RGS) might improve 
oncologic outcomes as compared with template sLND remains unknown. This study 
included 259 patients who experienced a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rise and 
nodal-only recurrence after radical prostatectomy and underwent pelvic sLND at 
11 tertiary referral centers between 2012 and 2022. Lymph node recurrence was 
documented by prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography 
scans. The outcomes included biochemical recurrence (BCR) and clinical 
recurrence (CR) after sLND. The probability of freedom from each outcome was 
calculated using Kaplan-Meier analyses. A Cox regression analysis was used to 
test the hypothesis that surgical technique for sLND (template vs RGS) might be 
associated with oncologic outcomes. Overall, 80 (31%) and 179 (69%) patients 
received template and radioguided sLND, respectively. PSA level at sLND was 
higher in the template than in the radioguided group (median: 1.3 vs 0.6 ng/ml; 
p < 0.0001), whereas the number of positive nodes on final pathology did not 
differ between the groups (p = 0.13). The first postoperative PSA level was 
higher in the template than in the radioguided group (median: 0.5 vs 0.1 ng/ml; 
p < 0.0001). Overall, there were 181 cases of BCR and 76 cases of CR after sLND. 
The median follow-up for survivors was 21 mo (interquartile range: 7, 36). The 
2-yr BCR-free survival rate for patients in the template versus RGS sLND group 
was 18% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 9%, 29%) versus 30% (95% CI: 22%, 37%). 
The 2-yr CR-free survival rate for the template versus RGS sLND group was 51% 
(95% CI: 35%, 65%) versus 73% (95% CI: 65%, 80%). On multivariable analyses, we 
did not find evidence of a statistically significant difference between the 
groups with respect to BCR after sLND (p = 0.7), whereas men treated with RGS 
had a lower risk of CR after sLND than those receiving template sLND (hazard 
ratio: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.29, 0.92; p < 0.026). Results of the sensitivity analyses 
were generally consistent with our main findings. Our data suggest that, in men 
with node-recurrent prostate cancer treated with sLND, RGS may offer important 
surgical guidance for surgeons, and this may eventually translate into improved 
oncologic outcomes. Awaiting further evidence on long-term outcomes of RGS, our 
study represents the most solid comparative data on different techniques for 
sLND and provides relevant data for counseling patients with node-only recurrent 
prostate cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a machine learning model of voxel level 
[18f]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) data could predict 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) pathology, as well as outperform currently 
available biomarkers.
METHODS: One hundred and thirty-seven autopsied patients with PSP (n = 42) and 
other neurodegenerative diseases (n = 95) who underwent antemortem 
[18f]fluorodeoxyglucose PET and 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans 
were analyzed. A linear support vector machine was applied to differentiate 
pathological groups with sensitivity analyses performed to assess the influence 
of voxel size and region removal. A radial basis function was also prepared to 
create a secondary model using the most important voxels. The models were 
optimized on the main dataset (n = 104), and their performance was compared with 
the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index measured on MRI in the independent 
test dataset (n = 33).
RESULTS: The model had the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-score (0.86) when voxel 
size was 6mm. In this optimized model, important voxels for differentiating the 
groups were observed in the thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar dentate. The 
secondary models found the combination of thalamus and dentate to have the 
highest accuracy (0.89) and F-score (0.81). The optimized secondary model showed 
the highest accuracy (0.91) and F-scores (0.86) in the test dataset and 
outperformed the magnetic resonance parkinsonism index (0.81 and 0.70, 
respectively).
INTERPRETATION: The results suggest that glucose hypometabolism in the thalamus 
and cerebellar dentate have the highest potential for predicting PSP pathology. 
Our optimized machine learning model outperformed the best currently available 
biomarker to predict PSP pathology. ANN NEUROL 2025;98:410-420.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterised by combined 
occurrence of parathyroid tumours, duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, and 
anterior pituitary adenomas. Some patients might also develop thymic and 
bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumours, and adrenal tumours. MEN1 is an 
autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene 
MEN1, which encodes a scaffold protein, menin. Without treatment, patients with 
MEN1 have high morbidity and premature mortality, which can be mitigated by 
early tumour detection and intervention. Identification of individuals at high 
risk for MEN1 can be facilitated by genetic testing of patients and their 
first-degree relatives, and undertaking periodic clinical, biochemical, and 
radiological screening in patients and MEN1 mutation carriers. However, no 
consensus exists regarding the optimal assessment and management of MEN1. To 
provide such recommendations, a multidisciplinary group was convened to 
undertake systematic reviews and a meta-analysis of the literature, and to use a 
Delphi approach for the development of consensus statements. 55 clinical 
recommendations were developed to guide clinicians, patients, and stakeholders 
about approaches for MEN1 in adults and children.

BACKGROUND: To describe longitudinal prevalence and risk factors associated with 
cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN), defined by heart rate variability 
(HRV) indices, and evaluate the impact of CAN on cardiovascular disease (CVD), 
in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) from the Epidemiology of Diabetes 
Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study.
METHODS: Standard resting electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were obtained 
annually in 997 participants (mean ± SD age 56.2 ± 6.8 years; T1D duration 
34.7 ± 7.9 years; 48% female) between 2015 and 2022. The standard deviation of 
normally conducted R-R intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive 
differences between normal-to-normal R-R intervals (rMSSD) were used to define 
CAN using previously validated cut-offs in this cohort from gold-standard 
cardiovascular reflex tests (CARTs). Generalized estimating equation models were 
used to evaluate the association of ECG-derived CAN with individual risk factors 
over repeated time points. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to describe the 
cumulative incidence of the first occurrence of any-CVD and of MACE by 
ECG-derived CAN status, and Cox proportional hazards regression models were used 
to estimate the effect of ECG-derived CAN adjusted for age and HbA1c.
RESULTS: The prevalence of ECG-derived CAN (~ 64%) was stable. Higher pulse rate 
(OR [95% CI] 1.08 [1.07,1.10] per 1 bpm) and HbA1c (1.43 [1.29,1.58] per 1%) 
were the most significant risk factors for CAN, followed by older age, male sex, 
higher albumin excretion rate, and hypertension history. The cumulative 
incidence of first occurrence of any-CVD over 7 years of follow-up was 
significantly higher in participants with vs. without CAN (HR [95% CI] any-CVD 
2.37 [1.43,3.94]), which remained significant adjusting for mean HbA1c and age, 
but was attenuated with further adjustment for other factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of and risk factors for standard resting ECG-derived 
CAN were similar to previously reported estimates from CARTs. CVD risk was 
significantly higher in those with vs. without CAN. These data support future 
studies examining the diagnostic utility of HRV indices at the point of care for 
risk stratification.

BACKGROUND: Evaluate survival outcomes of PN compared to RN in patients with 
T1-2, N0, M0 cRCC.
METHODS: Patients with cRCC were identified using the National Cancer Database 
(NCDB). Inclusion criteria included T1-2, N0, M0 disease, treatment with either 
PN or RN, and a Charleston Deyo co-morbidity score of 0. Patients with missing 
survival data, advanced staging, or incomplete surgical information were 
excluded. Propensity score matching was performed to create identical groups 
with respect to age, sex, and race. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, multinomial 
logistic regression, and cox proportional hazard models were used for 
statistical analysis.
RESULTS: Of the 476 eligible propensity matched patients, 238 (50.0%) underwent 
PN and 238 (50.0%) underwent RN. PN was associated with better survival (mean: 
186 vs. 170 months, P < 0.05) and lower odds of death (OR = 3.43; 95% CI, 
2.05-5.76; P < 0.05). Five- and ten-year survival rates for PN were 95.2% and 
91.1%, compared to 87.4% and 76.0% for RN. Patients treated with PN were 
significantly more likely to come from a higher income quartile and be treated 
at an academic/research facility.
CONCLUSION: Partial nephrectomy demonstrates superior survival and shorter 
hospital stays compared to radical nephrectomy in localized cRCC, reinforcing 
its role as the preferred surgical approach.

BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunction is common among patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease (IBD). For lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ+) 
patients, these challenges may be compounded by health disparities related to 
sexual health, stigma, and fear of discrimination in the clinical setting. There 
has been little research related to sexual health and IBD among this patient 
demographic.
METHODS: Patients with IBD who receive care at Massachusetts General Hospital 
and the Brigham and Women's Hospital were invited to participate in a 4-part 
survey on sexual health via an electronic patient portal messaging system and 
outpatient clinic flyers. Patients from the broader IBD community were invited 
to participate via social media outlets. Demographic data, IBD disease 
characteristics, and information related to health care experiences and 
interactions with IBD providers were collected. Sexual history information was 
obtained using an adapted version of the IBD-Specific Sexual Dysfunction Scale.
RESULTS: In total, 340 patients completed the survey, of which 20.3% (n = 69) 
identified as LGBTQ+. The majority of patients (75%, n = 255) reported distress 
in their sexual life due to IBD; however, only 5% (n = 17) of respondents had 
previously discussed the topic of sexual health with their IBD provider. One in 
4 LGBTQ+ patients listed fear of discrimination as a source of discomfort in 
these discussions, and a similar proportion expressed uncertainty regarding 
whether their sexual and/or gender identity negatively impacted their IBD care.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research and enhanced provider awareness of sexual health 
challenges related to IBD among LGBTQ+ patients may serve as an important step 
toward advancing inclusive and culturally sensitive care for this patient 
population.

Axillary surgery for breast cancer has evolved significantly during the last 
three decades in terms of both indications and techniques. De-escalation is 
intended to lessen complications of therapy without having a negative impact on 
oncologic outcomes. At the Transatlantic Breast Cancer Collaborative (TBCC) 
meeting, it was concluded that due to the significant variation in the 
terminology and techniques used for axillary surgery, comparison across studies 
is challenging. This report describes this inconsistent terminology and 
subsequent challenges and proposes standardizing terminology to sentinel lymph 
node surgery.

BACKGROUND: The SUMMIT trial showed that the long-acting glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic polypeptide receptor and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist 
tirzepatide decreased the risk of cardiovascular death or worsening heart 
failure (HF) in patients with obesity-related heart failure with preserved 
ejection fraction (HFpEF). Effects may differ by baseline obesity severity, 
distribution, or magnitude of weight loss.
OBJECTIVES: In this analysis, the authors compared baseline characteristics and 
effects of tirzepatide on primary and other endpoints according to baseline 
obesity severity and distribution, and we explored relationships between degree 
of weight loss achieved and outcomes.
METHODS: In the SUMMIT trial, 731 patients with NYHA functional class II-IV 
HFpEF and body mass index (BMI) ≥30 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to tirzepatide 
(n = 364) or placebo (n = 367). The primary outcomes were time to cardiovascular 
death or worsening HF and change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 
Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CSS) at 52 weeks. Key secondary outcomes included 
changes in 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), C-reactive protein (CRP), and body 
weight (BW) at 52 weeks. In this secondary analysis, primary and secondary 
endpoints were analyzed based on obesity severity (BMI) and distribution 
(waist-height ratio [WHR]). Time-to-event endpoints were analyzed with the use 
of a Cox regression model, and continuous endpoints were assessed with the use 
of a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Relationships between changes in 
BW and waist circumference (WC) on treatment with tirzepatide and changes in key 
endpoints also were evaluated.
RESULTS: Patients with obesity-related HFpEF and higher BMI were younger and 
more likely to be female, with more severe HF symptoms and physical limitations, 
greater volume expansion despite higher diuretic use and lower natriuretic 
peptide levels, and more severe systemic inflammation compared with patients 
with lower BMI. These findings were largely similar when contrasting patients by 
baseline WHR, but those with higher WHR also had poorer exercise capacity and 
more severe kidney disease. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in the effect 
of tirzepatide on the risk of worsening HF or cardiovascular death by BMI or WHR 
tertile. However, with increasing tertiles of baseline BMI, there were greater 
improvements in 6MWD (estimated treatment difference [ETD]: 9.9 vs 26.3 vs 37.5 
m; P = 0.025), and greater decreases in BW (ETD: -10.7% vs -11.8% vs -14.4%; P = 
0.006) and systolic blood pressure (ETD: -1.00 vs -6.65 vs -6.62 mm Hg; P = 
0.035) with tirzepatide compared with placebo, with a trend for greater 
improvement in KCCQ-CSS (P = 0.097). Among those randomized to tirzepatide, 
greater weight loss at 52 weeks was associated with larger improvements in 6MWD, 
KCCQ-CSS, CRP, and blood pressure, and a greater decrease in WC was associated 
with larger increases in 6MWD and KCCQ-CSS. Patients with elevated WHR but lower 
BMI had higher NYHA functional class and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic 
peptide, poorer kidney function, and lower 6MWD compared with those with lower 
WHR but higher BMI.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with obesity-related HFpEF, greater BMI is 
associated with younger age, female sex, more volume overload and inflammation, 
and more severe HF, and those with greater WHR also showed greater impairment in 
kidney function and exercise capacity. Tirzepatide consistently reduced the risk 
of HF or cardiovascular death regardless of baseline BMI, but there was evidence 
suggesting greater improvement in 6MWD in those with higher BMI at baseline. 
Greater weight loss on treatment with tirzepatide was associated with greater 
improvements in 6MWD and KCCQ. (A Study of Tirzepatide [LY3298176] in 
Participants With Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction [HfpEF] and 
Obesity [SUMMIT]; NCT04847557).

OBJECTIVE: We investigated differences in cognition between variants of 
progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) including PSP-Richardson (PSP-RS) and 
subcortical and cortical variants using updated diagnostic criteria and 
comprehensive neuropsychological assessment.
METHOD: We recruited 140 participants with PSP (age = 71.3 ± 6.9 years; 
education = 15.0 ± 2.8 years; 49.3% female) who completed neurological and 
neuropsychological assessment. Participants received diagnoses of PSP clinical 
variants at their evaluation (or retrospectively if evaluated before 2017) 
according to the Movement Disorder Society PSP criteria. We grouped variants as 
PSP-RS (62 participants), PSP-Cortical (25 with PSP-speech/language and 9 with 
PSP-corticobasal syndrome), and PSP-Subcortical (27 with PSP-parkinsonism, 11 
with PSP-progressive gait freezing, and 6 with PSP-postural instability). 
Analysis of covariance adjusted for age assessed for differences in 
neuropsychological performance between variants across cognitive domains.
RESULTS: PSP-Cortical participants performed worst on measures of visual 
attention/working memory (Spatial Span Forward/Backward/Total), executive 
function (Frontal Assessment Battery), and language (Letter Fluency). PSP-RS 
participants performed worst on verbal memory (Camden Words). There were no 
significant group differences for the MoCA or indices of visuospatial function. 
There were no sex or education differences between PSP groups; however, there 
were differences in age at visit and disease duration.
CONCLUSIONS: In a large sample of participants with PSP, there were differences 
in cognition across PSP-RS, PSP-Subcortical, and PSP-Cortical variants, with 
PSP-Cortical and, to a lesser extent, PSP-RS, performing worse on tests of 
attention and executive function. These findings suggest cognitive distinctions 
among PSP clinical variants and highlight the value of neuropsychological 
assessment in differential diagnosis of PSP subtypes for more accurate and 
timely clinical classification.

OBJECTIVE: Language used by providers in medical documentation may reveal 
evidence of race-related implicit bias. We aimed to use natural language 
processing (NLP) to examine if prevalence of stigmatizing language in emergency 
medicine (EM) encounter notes differs across patient race/ethnicity.
METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of EM encounters, NLP techniques identified 
stigmatizing and positive themes. Logistic regression models analyzed the 
association of race/ethnicity and themes within notes. Outcomes were the 
presence (or absence) of 7 different themes: 5 stigmatizing (difficult, 
non-compliant, skepticism, substance abuse/seeking, and financial difficulty) 
and 2 positive (compliment and compliant).
RESULTS: The sample included notes from 26,363 unique patients. NH Black patient 
notes were less likely to contain difficult (odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.88), skepticism (OR 0.87, 95% CI, 0.79-0.96), 
and substance abuse/seeking (OR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.56-0.70) compared to NH White 
patient notes but more likely to contain non-compliant (OR 1.26, 95% CI, 
1.17-1.36) and financial difficulty (OR 1.14, 95% CI, 1.04-1.25). Hispanic 
patient notes were less likely to contain difficult (OR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.58-0.80) 
and substance abuse/seeking (OR 0.78, 95% CI, 0.66-0.93). NH NA/AI patient notes 
had twice the odds as NH White patient notes to contain a stigmatizing theme (OR 
2.02, 95% CI, 1.64-2.49).
CONCLUSIONS: Using an NLP model to analyze themes in EM notes across racial 
groups, we identified several inequities in the usage of positive and 
stigmatizing language. Interventions to minimize race-related implicit bias 
should be undertaken.

This mini-review discusses important factors in opioid use in gynecologic 
oncology in the perioperative setting. Evidence-based prescribing guidelines, 
multimodal analgesia strategies, and individualized care in patients with a 
history of opioid use are discussed. Opioid tapering and its potential risks are 
also discussed. Additionally, we touch on machine learning in optimizing 
analgesia. By bridging evidence-based practices and advancements, this review 
outlines actionable recommendations to maximize patient care and facilitate 
responsible opioid stewardship in gynecologic oncology.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether molecular classification could support 
individualized selection of patients with grade II endometrioid endometrial 
cancer for fertility-sparing approaches.
METHODS: This is a retrospective multi-institutional study. Data of patients 
undergoing fertility-sparing treatment with a levonorgestrel intrauterine device 
(with or without oral hormonal therapy) were retrieved. Surrogate molecular 
classification was used to categorize patients into 4 classes: (1) POLE-mutated, 
(2) mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instability high, (3) p53 abnormal, 
and (4) no specific molecular profile.
RESULTS: Overall, data from 23 patients with grade II endometrioid endometrial 
cancer starting a fertility-sparing attempt were retrieved. The median patient 
age was 36 (range; 30-41) years. All patients underwent hysteroscopic-guided 
endometrial biopsies. Hysteroscopic resection of the tumor was performed in 9 
(39.1%) patients. According to surrogate molecular classification, 1 (4.3%), 2 
(8.7%), 3 (13.1%), and 17 (73.9%) patients were classified as POLE-mutated, p53 
abnormal, mismatch repair deficient/microsatellite instability high, and no 
specific molecular profile, respectively. Molecular classification was not 
associated with 6-month response rates (p = .080) nor with best response rates 
(p = .366). Overall, 7 women attempted to achieve a pregnancy; 3 underwent in 
vitro fertilization. Three patients achieved a pregnancy (1 first-trimester 
miscarriage and 2 term live births). A total of 10 (43.4%) patients were 
diagnosed with progressive disease during hysteroscopic surveillance. Overall, 
19 (82.6%) patients required hysterectomy. Three (13%) patients required 
adjuvant therapy for the presence of locally advanced disease (1 stage II, and 2 
stage III). Over a median (range) follow-up of 28.7(8.2-91.1) months, no 
recurrence or disease-related death occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: Less than 10% of women with grade II endometrioid endometrial 
cancer starting a fertility-sparing attempt achieve a term pregnancy. In our 
series, molecular classification did not influence response rate. Further 
collaborative registers are needed.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Invasive coronary function testing (CFT) identifies 
coronary vasomotor disorders in up to 90% of patients with angina with 
non-obstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA). The ILIAS ANOCA trial hypothesized 
that routine ad hoc CFT would be feasible, safe, and effective in providing an 
early, comprehensive diagnosis. Additionally, it was anticipated that combining 
CFT with a disease-specific treatment protocol would significantly improve 
quality of life in ANOCA patients compared with standard care.
METHODS: After excluding patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) 
during clinically indicated invasive coronary angiography (ICA), eligible 
patients underwent CFT and were randomized to either the standard care group, 
where CFT results remained blinded, or the intervention group, where CFT results 
were disclosed along with a tailored medical therapy protocol. The primary 
outcome was the mean difference in the within-subject change in Seattle Angina 
Questionnaire summary score (SAQSS) between groups from baseline to a follow-up 
of 6 months. The trial is registered with the International Clinical Trials 
Registry Platform (NL-OMON20739).
RESULTS: A total of 255 patients consented, of whom 153 patients (60%) without 
CAD underwent CFT and were randomized 1:1 to the standard care (n = 76) or 
intervention group (n = 77). All CFT procedures were successful without adverse 
events. A vasomotor disorder was identified in 120 patients (78%). At 6-month 
follow-up, the SAQSS improved significantly in the intervention group compared 
with the control group, with an intervention effect of 9.4 units (95% confidence 
interval 3.9-14.9, P = .001). There were no major adverse cardiac events at the 
6-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine CFT during the initial ICA was feasible, safe, and had high 
diagnostic yield. Implementing a pragmatic CFT protocol combined with a 
disease-specific treatment protocol significantly improved disease-related 
quality of life in patients with ANOCA compared with standard care.

BACKGROUND: Angina with nonobstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA) is a major 
cause of chronic coronary syndromes, affecting nearly half of patients with 
anginal symptoms who undergo invasive coronary angiography. ANOCA may lead to 
substantial symptom burden, increased risk of adverse cardiac events, increased 
healthcare utilization due to ongoing symptoms, repeat hospitalizations, and 
invasive testing. The pathophysiology of ANOCA often involves a variety of 
coronary disorders, such as coronary microvascular dysfunction, epicardial or 
microvascular vasospasm and endothelial dysfunction. While coronary function 
testing (CFT) can identify each of these specific endotypes, in current practice 
it is used as a second- or third-line diagnostic tool, delaying diagnosis which 
contributes to persistent symptoms and diminished quality of life. The ILIAS 
ANOCA clinical trial aims to enhance understanding and management of ANOCA 
through early routine CFT-guided management.
METHODS: After exclusion of obstructive coronary artery disease, eligible 
patients undergo comprehensive CFT, and will be randomized to blinding of the 
CFT results (control group) or disclosure of the CFT results combined with a 
tailored medical therapy escalation plan (intervention group). The control group 
will be unblinded after 1 year. The primary outcome is the mean difference in 
the within-subject change in Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) summary score 
between the groups at 6 months from baseline. Secondary outcomes include 
differences in SAQ-summary score and additional health-status and quality of 
life questionnaires at 12 and 24 months from baseline.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review was to determine the patency and 
complications related to percutaneous metallic biliary stent placement for 
malignant biliary obstruction in the current literature.
METHODS: This review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items of 
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. EMBASE and PubMed were queried 
yielding 891 articles, 18 of which were included in the final analysis. The 
Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to appraise article quality. 
Patient demographics, technical success rate, and procedure outcomes were 
recorded. Complications were classified as "major" if they resulted in blood 
transfusion or additional invasive procedures or were reported as such in the 
literature. Complications that did not meet these criteria were classified as 
"minor".
RESULTS: A total of 1,453 patients (677 female; weighted age 66.8 years) 
underwent biliary stent placement. The weighted technical success rate was 
97.7%. The incidence of stent occlusion was 13.5% with 6.6% of patients 
requiring further intervention to maintain patency. There were 277 (19.1%) 
complications, of which 87 were classified as major. The most common 
complications were pancreatitis (93, 6.4%), cholangitis (69, 4.8%), and bleeding 
(64, 4.4%). In cases of bleeding, 4.7% of patients needed a blood transfusion 
and 15.6% required a procedure to treat bleeding. There were 6 (0.4%) 
procedure-related deaths.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, percutaneous metallic stent placement for malignant 
biliary obstruction has a high technical success rate and relatively low rate of 
occlusion. Although nearly one in five procedures resulted in a complication, 
most cases were minor.

More than 850 million individuals worldwide, accounting for 10-15% of the adult 
population, are estimated to have chronic kidney disease. Each of these 
individuals is host to tens of trillions of microorganisms that are collectively 
referred to as microbiota - a dynamic ecosystem that both influences host health 
and is itself influenced by changes in the host. Available evidence supports the 
existence of functional connections between resident microorganisms and kidney 
health that are altered in the context of specific kidney diseases, including 
acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease and renal stone disease. Moreover, 
promising data from preclinical studies suggest that targeting of gut microbial 
pathways may provide new therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of kidney 
disease. This Roadmap describes current understanding of the mechanisms by which 
microorganisms regulate host organ function, the effects of kidney disease on 
the gut microbiome, and how these insights may contribute to the development of 
microbe-targeted therapeutics. We highlight key knowledge gaps that remain to be 
addressed and strategies for addressing these, outlining both the promise and 
the potential pitfalls of leveraging our understanding of the gut microbiota to 
better understand and treat kidney disease.

BACKGROUND: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) has conducted a practice 
survey every five years since 1974 to guide decision-making and resource 
allocation.
METHODS: The 2024 Practice Survey, conducted online between January 25 to March 
14, 2024, included a 72-question survey distributed to 4,692 active STS members 
from the Senior, Surgeon, and Resident/Fellow member categories. A total of 
1,027 responses (22%) were received and interpreted. Other non-surgeon members 
were not included in this survey.
RESULTS: Most surgeon respondents were men (86%) and white (65%), with an 
increased representation of women in the field. Mean respondent age was 55.8 
years. The traditional training pathway remains prevalent (87%), though 
additional training beyond cardiothoracic residency increased to 41%. There has 
been an increase in academic (46%) and government (2%) positions, while 
hospital-based and private practice has declined. Overall career satisfaction 
was 80% (43% very satisfied and 37% somewhat satisfied). In addition, symptoms 
of burnout and depression along with workplace challenges, including 
discrimination and harassment were reported by 55.7% of surgeons. The average 
salary for STS members is commensurate with the 2024 STS Compensation Survey. 
Research participation has declined slightly. Lastly, the use of electronic 
health records is evolving, with more surgeons finding them easier to use 
compared to previous years.
CONCLUSIONS: This member survey highlighted that cardiothoracic surgeons are 
largely satisfied with their career, but also identified challenges in work-life 
balance. The STS remains committed to supporting its members by addressing their 
evolving career practices and needs, fostering professional growth, and 
advancing the field of cardiothoracic surgery.

Effective markers for early detection of Wilson disease are of interest. 
Recently, a labile bound copper assay has been developed for the evaluation of 
copper disorders, which in concert with total copper concentrations can 
effectively detect Wilson disease in adults. Newborn labile bound copper (LBC) 
concentrations may also resemble those observed in adult patients with Wilson 
disease, as newborns exhibit low total copper concentrations and limited 
ceruloplasmin production. The primary goal of this study was to investigate LBC 
and total copper concentrations in newborns (0-4 weeks of age) and 
infants (5-29 weeks of age) and to compare them to those seen in adult patients 
with Wilson disease. Associations between LBC, LBC fraction, and total copper 
versus bilirubin concentrations in newborns were also investigated. Serum 
samples originally measured for bilirubin concentrations were analyzed for 
labile bound copper, labile bound copper fraction, and total serum copper by 
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Nearly 35% of newborns had labile 
bound copper fraction values that were above the adult reference interval 
cutoff, resembling values seen in adults with Wilson disease. Labile bound 
copper fraction values in pre-term newborns were higher than in full-term 
newborns, and pre-term newborns had lower total copper concentrations compared 
to full-term newborns. Finally, after adjusting for age, total copper 
concentrations in both newborns and infants were negatively correlated with both 
total bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin. While the labile bound copper assay 
may not be suitable for evaluating newborns for Wilson disease, it may be a 
useful tool to assess copper metabolism.

BACKGROUND: Percutaneous ablation of parathyroid adenomas provides a minimally 
invasive treatment option for primary hyperparathyroidism. However, the overall 
performance of this technique remains underexplored. This meta-analysis 
evaluates the effectiveness and safety of various ablation techniques for 
parathyroid adenomas.
METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses guidelines, multiple databases, including Ovid MEDLINE and 
Cochrane, were systematically searched. Studies that provided separate data for 
radiofrequency (RF), microwave ablation (MWA), and ethanol ablation technique 
were included. Outcomes of interest were changes in serum calcium, PTH, and 
phosphorus levels, along with normocalcemia rates at 6 to 12 months after 
ablation. Safety outcomes included transient hoarseness, permanent hoarseness, 
severe hemorrhage, major complications, and severe hypocalcemia. Data were 
pooled using a random-effects model, with pooled prevalence and 95% CIs 
calculated. Also, the publication bias was assessed with Egger's test for each 
outcome measure.
RESULTS: Twenty studies (815 patients) were included. The posttreatment 
normocalcemia rate at 6 to 12 months was 85.6% (95% CI, 80.48-90.72). Serum PTH 
and calcium levels significantly decreased, with mean differences of 
101.49 pg/mL (95% CI, 73.50-129.48) and 0.39 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.34-.45), 
respectively. Permanent hoarseness and major complications were rare, with 
incidences of 0.28% (95% CI, 0.00-1.05) and 0.31% (95% CI, 0.00-1.09). The 
safety and efficacy outcomes of RF, MWA, and ethanol ablation were comparable.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that percutaneous ablation of parathyroid 
adenomas is safe and effective within the first year of the treatment. 
Additionally, they suggest that RF, MWA, and ethanol ablation techniques can 
each be employed depending on patients' needs without particular limitations.

In comparative effectiveness research (CER), ensuring internal, construct, and 
external validity is crucial. Internal validity determines whether observed 
outcomes are causally linked to an intervention; construct validity assesses 
whether a study measures what it intends to; and external validity relates to 
generalizability in routine practice. Double-blind randomized trials optimize 
internal validity by minimizing bias and confounding, while construct validity 
is strengthened through pre-specified protocols and standardized data 
collection. However, controlled conditions limit external validity. Pragmatic 
RCTs improve generalizability but may compromise internal validity due to 
open-label designs. Observational CER studies-including observational studies 
following the target trial emulation framework-offer broader external validity 
and feasibility in less time and at lower cost. However, due to lack of random 
assignment, these studies are susceptible to measured and unmeasured 
confounding. Several techniques help mitigate these concerns, including a 
detailed pre-specified protocol, tools such as propensity score matching to 
balance measured confounders, falsification endpoint testing for assessing the 
presence of unmeasured confounders, and quasi-experimental designs (including 
instrumental variable analysis), which may be able to address both. 
Pre-specified sensitivity analyses and triangulation with complementary data 
sources further enhance robustness. Construct validity in observational CER 
depends on accurate patient profiling and validated computational phenotypes for 
identifying patients, exposures, and outcomes. Thoughtful study design and 
analytic rigor are essential for balancing these validity considerations. This 
brief review highlights these issues with examples from thrombosis research.

It is unknown how many children with obesity are offered treatments aligned with 
clinical practice guidelines. This study examined electronic medical record data 
from a Midwest, USA, health system to quantify referrals to obesity treatment 
among patients 2-17 years old with obesity presenting for well-child visits in 
2022 and/or 2023. Mixed-effects logistic regression models tested associations 
of referral placement with child characteristics, the Area Deprivation Index, 
and distance to specialty care. Of 14,893 patients, 591 (4.0%) received a 
referral. Referrals were associated with severe obesity (p < 0.001), older age 
(p < 0.001), proximity to specialty care (p < 0.001), number of well-visits (p ≤ 
0.001), and identification with a minoritized race or ethnicity (p < 
0.05-0.001). Findings indicate a large gap from the current state of referrals 
to alignment with practice guidelines for pediatric obesity. Furthermore, 
research needs to explore and address barriers to referrals and treatment 
access.

Movement disorders, including dystonia and tremor, are debilitating in the 
pediatric population. Neurometabolic syndromes such as classic galactosemia 
represent a subset of etiologies of pediatric movement disorders for which 
limited data is available to guide treatment. Deep brain stimulation, though 
rarely performed, is an option for pediatric patients with refractory symptoms. 
Here, we report a case of a 14-year-old boy with progressive, refractory 
generalized dystonia and cerebellar tremor resulting from classic galactosemia. 
He underwent implantation of bilateral thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus and 
globus pallidus internus for deep brain stimulation. The patient experienced 
durable improvement in both tremor and dystonia over a 6-year follow-up period. 
Dual-target, bilateral deep brain stimulation can be an effective therapy for 
alleviation of mixed movement disorders resulting from classic galactosemia in 
carefully selected patients. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which 
dual-target deep brain stimulation has been implemented in the setting of 
galactosemia-induced tremor and may be a promising treatment paradigm in this 
patient population.

STUDY DESIGN: A meta-analysis approach to a systematic review.
OBJECTIVE: Perform a systematic review to identify all reports directly 
comparing outcomes of lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) using static versus 
expandable interbody cages. Specifically focusing on periprocedural 
complications, intraoperative morbidity, and fusion outcomes.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Minimally invasive surgical techniques, particularly 
LLIF, have gained popularity for their potential to reduce muscle and soft 
tissue dissection, leading to faster postoperative recovery. LLIF has been 
associated with fewer complications compared with open posterior approaches. The 
introduction of expandable lumbar interbody devices aims to further reduce 
surgical difficulty and potential complications. However, concerns include a 
small graft window due to the expansion mechanism and higher costs.
METHODS: The Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases were systematically 
queried in accordance with PRISMA guidelines to identify articles comparing 
outcomes following LLIF using static and expandable interbodies. The 
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was employed to assess the risk of bias (ROB) in 
the selected studies. Extracted data underwent effect-size meta-analysis with 
the PyMARE library, using P <0.05 to define statistical significance.
RESULTS: Of the 77 identified articles, 4 studies comprising 283 patients (mean 
age: 67.1 y, 55.8% female) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 
150 patients (53%) were treated with static interbodies compared with 133 (47%) 
receiving expandable interbodies. The groups did not differ significantly with 
respect to operative time ( P =0.59), blood loss ( P =0.89), length of stay ( P 
=0.78), subsidence ( P =0.49), 24-month mean disc height ( P =0.11), 24-month 
mean ODI ( P =0.58), or 24-month mean visual analog scale (VAS) back pain ( P 
=0.81). The expandable group saw a trend toward improved fusion rates (97% vs. 
92%, P =0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis suggests the use of expandable (vs. 
static) interbodies in LLIF surgery may result in similar surgical morbidity, 
subsidence, and decompression. Further prospective comparative studies are 
merited to validate these results.

Objective: To examine prospective associations of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test positivity, coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-2019) symptom severity, and COVID-2019 hospitalization with incident 
clinical diabetes among aging women. Methods: A cohort study was conducted using 
data from 34,405 eligible Women's Health Initiative participants who completed 
≥1 COVID-2019 surveys (Survey 1: June-December 2020; Survey 2: June 
2021-February 2022) and were followed up for an average of 1.86 (±0.49) years, 
yielding 399 incident diabetes cases. Results: SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was 
associated with diabetes risk in the age-adjusted Cox regression model (hazard 
ratio [HR] = 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10, 2.82), but not when fully 
adjusted (HR = 1.43, 95% CI: 0.88, 2.31). Diabetes risk was higher among those 
with 1-2 COVID-19 symptoms (HR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.77) and those with 3± 
COVID-2019 symptoms (HR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.22) compared with those without 
COVID-2019 symptoms in fully-adjusted models, irrespective of self-reported 
SARS-CoV-2 testing. COVID-2019 hospitalization was associated with 2-3 times the 
risk of clinical diabetes in age-adjusted (HR = 2.95, 95% CI: 1.52, 5.72) and 
fully-adjusted (HR = 1.90, 95% CI: 0.97, 3.72) models. Conclusions: Age-adjusted 
self-reported SARS-CoV-2 test positivity was associated with a higher incidence 
of diabetes. Reporting of COVID-2019 symptoms and being hospitalized for 
COVID-2019 were each associated with higher incidence of diabetes in aging 
women, after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health 
characteristics.

BACKGROUND: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) poses a significant health 
risk to immunocompromised hosts due to the increased risk of severe infection 
and recurrence. Microbiota-based therapies have emerged as a promising strategy 
for CDI, but safety and efficacy in immunocompromised populations remain 
underexplored.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search across Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid EMBASE, 
Clinicaltrials.gov, and Scopus from inception until December 16, 2024, 
identified studies meeting inclusion criteria, covering fecal microbiota 
transplantation (FMT) for recurrent CDI (rCDI) in immunocompromised individuals, 
including those on immunosuppressants, transplant recipients, undergoing 
chemotherapy, and with advanced HIV. Case reports and studies not separately 
reporting outcomes in immunocompromised patients were excluded. Statistical 
analysis was performed using random-effects models to account for heterogeneity 
among studies.
RESULTS: A total of 44 studies (31 full-text articles, 13 abstracts) were 
included, comprising 3,476 participants, of whom 1,208 were immunocompromised. 
The population included solid organ transplant recipients (n=219), cancer 
patients on chemotherapy (n=101), hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients 
(n=29), and advanced HIV patients (n=11). The most common FMT route was 
colonoscopy (n=12 studies), followed by upper gastrointestinal routes, capsules, 
and rectal retention enemas. The clinical resolution rate after a single FMT was 
75.3% (95% CI 71.7%-78.6%), increasing to 87.4% (95% CI 84.8%-89.6%) with 
consecutive treatments. The recurrence rate was 23.9% (95% CI 19.2%-29.4%), and 
the serious adverse event rate was 10.1% (95% CI 6.7%-14.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: The safety and effectiveness outcomes of FMT in mild to moderately 
immunocompromised populations for recurrent CDI are comparable to those in 
immunocompetent cohorts.

BACKGROUND: Brain injury medicine (BIM) is a medical subspecialty addressing the 
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of individuals with brain injury. BIM 
fellowships have been accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate 
Medical Education (ACGME) since 2014.
OBJECTIVE: To identify practice patterns of physiatrists who have completed an 
ACGME-accredited BIM fellowship and assess the training satisfaction and 
potential opportunities for enhancement of BIM fellowship training.
DESIGN: Online cross-sectional survey.
SETTING: A national cross-sectional survey of BIM physiatrists was designed in 
conjunction with the American Board of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.
PARTICIPANTS: Physiatrists who had graduated from an ACGME-accredited BIM 
fellowship between 2014 and 2023.
INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Demographic information, current practice patterns, and 
levels of satisfaction (very unsatisfied to very satisfied) with fellowship 
training in areas of core competency.
RESULTS: The survey was completed by 61 BIM fellowship graduates. Fifty-one 
percent of respondents identified as male, and 46% reported practicing in the 
Northeast. Seventy-seven percent of respondents held teaching roles at a medical 
school, and 82% were in a clinical leadership role. Eighty-seven percent 
reported performing botulinum toxin injections in their current practice. 
Overall, respondents reported a high degree of satisfaction with fellowship 
training.
CONCLUSIONS: Survey respondents work predominantly in the Northeast, in both 
inpatient and outpatient environments, and are more likely to work in academic 
medical centers. Survey respondents commonly held clinical and academic 
leadership roles. Phenol/alcohol neurolysis, respiratory complications, pain 
management, and special brain injury populations were identified as potential 
areas for further fellowship development.

Laboratory Medicine is growing at a rapid rate in both the breadth of unique 
tests and the total number of tests performed per year. Inappropriate 
overutilization of laboratory tests can lead to patient harm, excessive 
environmental waste and increased carbon emissions. A focus on reducing 
inefficiencies in healthcare is needed to ensure a robust and sustainable 
healthcare system. To promote laboratory sustainability, the Canadian Society of 
Clinical Chemists (CSCC) has developed ten recommendations related to medical 
tests within clinical biochemistry. These recommendations are designed as 
'low-hanging fruit' that should be adopted by both hospital and community 
laboratories. By implementing automated strategies and/or educational approaches 
to reduce misuse of laboratory resources, clinical laboratories can move toward 
a more sustainable model that improves patient care. This list of 
recommendations, created for Choosing Wisely Canada, covers tests for diabetes, 
celiac disease, monoclonal gammopathies, iron disorders, liver disorders, kidney 
disorders, substance use disorders, and allergen testing.

BACKGROUND: To explore the prevalence of serious adverse events (SAEs) 
associated with retinal viral gene therapy and to examine trends influencing SAE 
occurrences in human gene therapy surgeries and pre-clinical animal trials.
METHODS: Literature review was performed to identify peer-reviewed human and 
animal studies relevant to viral gene therapy, subretinal injections, and 
intravitreal injections. For clinical trials and post-approval LUXTURNA studies, 
only those that examined SAEs were included.
RESULTS: Of included clinical trial studies (n = 31), SAEs were recorded in 51 
out of 438 eyes (11.6%) that received subretinal injections and in 11 out of 348 
eyes (3.2%) that received intravitreal injections. There were fewer 
intravitreal-related SAEs and less vision loss compared to subretinal gene 
therapy. Inflammation was the predominant SAE following intravitreal injections, 
whereas unexplained vision loss was the most common for subretinal injections. 
Clinical trials utilising subretinal injections met primary or secondary 
efficacy endpoints more than intravitreal trials. Eighteen studies (429 eyes) of 
post-approval LUXTURNA were reviewed, and SAEs were reported in 24.7% of eyes, 
retinal degeneration being most common (20.7%). For 58 animal studies, SAEs were 
recorded in 17.3% of eyes that received subretinal injections and 8.7% of eyes 
that received intravitreal injections.
CONCLUSIONS: Subretinal injections show higher efficacy than intravitreal 
injections but are associated with more serious adverse events. Consistent 
adverse event patterns in humans and large animals highlight their predictive 
value for safety. There is a need for optimised delivery methods, refined dosing 
protocols, and improved post-treatment monitoring to improve safety and 
effectiveness in gene therapy.

BACKGROUND: Acute heart failure (AHF) is associated with high mortality and 
contemporary medical treatments provide limited benefits in survival. Emerging 
evidence suggests that exogenous ketone bodies may have beneficial 
cardiovascular effects in patients with heart failure. The KETO-AHF trial is 
designed to assess the clinical benefits of initiating ketone supplementation 
with 1,3-butanediol compared with placebo in patients hospitalized for AHF with 
reduced ejection fraction.
METHODS: KETO-AHF is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
trial investigating the effects of 1,3-butanediol (33 g three times daily) in 
patients hospitalized for AHF. Patients with symptoms and signs of AHF requiring 
intravenous loop diuretics and/or vasoactive treatment, elevated natriuretic 
peptides, and a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35%, whether de novo or 
known heart failure, will be enrolled within five days of hospital admission. 
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 1,3-butanediol or placebo 
for a 30-day treatment period. The study aims to enroll 125 patients in each 
group. The primary endpoint is a hierarchical composite of all-cause mortality, 
heart failure rehospitalization, six-minute walk test improvement, and reduction 
in NT-proBNP levels at 30 days.
CONCLUSION: The KETO-AHF trial will provide insights into the effects of 
supplementation with the ketone body 1,3-butanediol in patients hospitalized for 
AHF.

What Is the Potential Relevance of Growth and Differentiation Factor-15 in 
Neurologic Disease?

Benarroch E(1).

Author information:
(1)From the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

Growth and differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) is a multifunctional cytokine that 
is a distant member of both the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) 
superfamily and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family.1-6 GDF-15 
is released in physiologic conditions, such as pregnancy or muscle exercise, but 
its levels increase particularly in the setting of cellular stress associated 
with mitochondrial dysfunction and tissue injury.7,8 GDF-15 is a central 
inhibitor of appetite9,10 and regulates energy homeostasis,2-5 inflammation,11 
and carcinogenesis12 (Figure). The effects of GDF-15 signaling can be beneficial 
or detrimental, depending on their timing, magnitude, and duration.5 Circulating 
levels of GDF-15 increase with aging and can be markedly elevated in several 
pathologic conditions, including obesity, diabetes, renal disease, 
cardiovascular disease, and cancer, where they are typically associated with 
poor outcomes.13-17 The role of GDF-15 in the pathogenesis and as a biomarker 
and therapeutic target in these disorders has been extensively reviewed4-6 and 
will not be further discussed here. Circulating GDF-15 levels also increase in 
patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy,18 mitochondrial myopathy,19 
neurodegenerative disorders,20-22 and glioma.23 Although experimental evidence 
suggests that GDF-15 may have a potential neuroprotective role against 
neurodegeneration22,24 and a detrimental role in glioma,24 its role as a 
biomarker and therapeutic target in neurologic disorders is yet to be 
established.

Human chromosomal anomalies, notably trisomies, disrupt gene expression, leading 
to diverse cellular and organ phenotypes. Increased cellular senescence (SEN) 
and oxidative stress in trisomies have gained recent attention. We assessed SEN, 
SEN-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and oxidative stress on trisomy 13 
(T13), T18, and T21 human fetal lung tissues and isolated primary human fetal 
lung fibroblasts. Telomerase-associated foci staining showed DNA damage 
primarily within T21 and T18 lungs. These results were confirmed by real-time 
quantitative PCR showing an increase of the SEN marker CDKN2B and SASP markers 
IL-6 and CXCL8. In contrast, lung tissues from T13 showed an upregulation of 
CDKN2A, whereas no significant changes in SASP marker genes were observed. 
γ-H2AX (H2A histone family member X) was upregulated in each genotype, 
particularly in T21. Isolated fibroblasts demonstrated a strong association 
between T21 and several SEN markers. An increase of γ-H2AX-positive cells were 
observed in fibroblasts from T21, T18, and T13, but only T21 exhibited an 
increase in P21 expression. Only T21 fibroblasts displayed a significant 
increase in reactive oxygen species levels, as indicated by MitoSOX and CellROX. 
This study provides the first evidence of a link between SEN and trisomy 
anomalies during prenatal human lung development, particularly in T21.

BACKGROUND: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a connective tissue disease which can lead 
to aortic aneurysm and dissection. The performance outcomes of total aortic arch 
replacement with frozen elephant trunk (FET) are not well known in these 
patients. This study summarizes our experience with FET in MFS.
METHODS: Between August 2001 and December 2021, 435 patients underwent FET at 
Hannover Medical School. Of these, 34 patients had MFS. The mean age was 
43.3±11.9 years and 27 (79%) were male. The indication for surgery was aortic 
aneurysm in 1 (3%), acute aortic dissection in 12 (35%), and chronic aortic 
dissection in 21 (62%) patients.
RESULTS: All patients underwent total aortic arch replacement with FET. In 
addition, the following procedures were performed: conventional aortic root 
replacement (Bentall operation, n=8), valve-sparing aortic root replacement 
(David procedure, n=8), coronary artery bypass grafting (n=3), mitral valve 
surgery (n=2), and tricuspid valve surgery (n=1). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) 
and aortic cross clamp times were 270±87 and 139±69 minutes, respectively. 
Postoperatively, there were 2 (6%) disabling strokes, and 0 (0%) patients 
required permanent dialysis or suffered from permanent paraplegia, respectively. 
In-hospital mortality was 12% (n=4). The mean follow-up time was 8.4±5.9 years. 
The 1-, 5-, 10, and 15-year survival rates were 82%, 70%, 70% and 65, 
respectively. There were 18 (53%) re-interventions on the distal aorta. Mean 
time to re-intervention was 2.7±3.1 years. The majority of patients underwent 
open surgical repair (n=14, 77%), while only 4 (22%) had endovascular therapy. 
The freedom from distal aortic re-intervention at 1-, 5-, 10- and 15 years was 
86%, 61%, 55% and 44%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The main indication for FET surgery in MFS is acute or chronic 
aortic dissection. Despite multiple concomitant procedures, early mortality was 
relatively low, suggesting that FET is feasible and effective to treat complex 
aortic pathology in MFS. However, our study showed a high incidence of distal 
aortic re-interventions, underscoring the progressive nature of the disease and 
the need for tailored long-term management strategies.

BACKGROUND: Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is an aggressive tumor associated 
with sickle cell trait. Despite treatment advances for other rare renal tumors, 
RMC survival remains poor. We aimed to describe the contemporary management and 
survival of children and adults with RMC.
PROCEDURE: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, Pediatric Surgical 
Oncology Research Collaborative sites searched their databases for patients 
diagnosed with RMC (2000-2022). Descriptive statistics were calculated and 
survival analyses performed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression.
RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with RMC were identified. Median age was 19 years 
(IQR: 15-28; range: 7-52). Most were male (24/34; 71%), Black (27/32; 84%), had 
sickle cell trait or disease (30/33; 91%), presented with metastatic disease 
(27/34; 79%), and were symptomatic at presentation (32/34; 94%). Median overall 
survival (OS) was 24 months from diagnosis (16 months for children, 28 months 
for adults, p = 0.6). Receipt of platinum-based chemotherapy (23/34; 68%) was 
associated with significantly higher OS than other regimens (35 vs. 5 months, 
p < 0.001). Nephrectomy (24/34; 71%) was associated with significantly improved 
OS compared with non-operative management (34 vs. 7 months, p = 0.001). 
Immunotherapy, targeted therapy, or radiation therapy were not associated with 
significant differences in OS, nor were age, sex, race, sickle cell status, 
SMARCB1/INI-1, stage, nephrectomy approach, retroperitoneal lymph node 
dissection, gross residual disease, margins, or tumor size.
CONCLUSIONS: RMC survival remains poor despite newer therapies. Nephrectomy and 
platinum-based chemotherapy should be considered in locally advanced and 
metastatic disease. Coordinated international cooperative group studies are 
needed to meaningfully improve RMC survival.

OBJECTIVES: In 2023, AMIA's Inclusive Language and Context Style Guidelines (the 
"Guidelines") were approved by the Board of Directors and made a publicly 
available resource. This work began in 2021 through AMIA's DEI Task Force and 
subsequent DEI Committee; many members provided input, feedback, and time to 
create the Guidelines. In this paper, the authors provide a transparent account 
of the origin, development, contents, and dissemination of the Guidelines and 
share plans for their future development and use.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our approach to drafting, refining, and distributing the 
Guidelines included consulting existing language guides, AMIA member reviews, 
external expert reviews, webinars, and workshops. Through an iterative approach 
to drafting and refining the Guidelines, the authors consulted relevant language 
guidelines and many experts throughout and beyond the AMIA community.
RESULTS: The Inclusive Language Context Guidelines were formally approved by the 
AMIA Board of Directors on February 15, 2023. The Guidelines included four 
principles to be considered in scientific communications: Plurality, Precision, 
Transparency, and Destigmatization.
DISCUSSION: A moment of vulnerability where an AMIA member raised concerns about 
the use of harmful language during a presentation resulted in the creation of a 
principled approach to support inclusive language within biomedical and health 
informatics communications. We envision that the Guidelines will support health 
equity by challenging dominant public narratives around health, fostering 
stronger interdisciplinary collaboration and critical thinking about the impact 
of language, and creating a more welcoming environment for the broader AMIA 
community. This work could not have been completed without the support of many 
AMIA members and other researchers in biomedical and health informatics. The 
Guidelines are a living document that will continue to be updated with input and 
feedback from the AMIA community into the future.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic recurrence of colorectal cancer (mCRC) after adjuvant 
therapy may differ biologically from recurrence in untreated mCRC. We examined 
first-line treatment outcomes of patients within the phase III CALGB/SWOG 80405 
(CALGB 80405) and FIRE-3 trials according to previous exposure to 
oxaliplatin-based adjuvant treatment.
METHODS: Patients from CALGB 80405 primary analysis (N = 1131) and FIRE-3 
intent-to-treat population (N = 592) treated with FOLFIRI who previously 
received either oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy or no adjuvant therapy were 
identified. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 
estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. 
Adjusted Cox regression models were used to compare outcomes according to 
biologic agent and prior adjuvant treatment.
RESULTS: A total of 800 patients were included in the analysis. There were no 
significant differences in OS and PFS based on adjuvant treatment. Among 
patients who received adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (N = 123), median 
PFS was 11.5 months for FOLFIRI-bevacizumab (bev) and 10.1 months for 
FOLFIRI-cetuximab (cet) (adjusted HR [95 %CI] = 0.81 [0.56, 1.18], p = 0.27). 
Median OS in the same group was 41.0 months for bev- vs 28.5 months for 
cet-treated patients (adjusted HR 95 %CI] = 0.78 [0.51, 1.20], p = 0.26). No 
significant interaction between treatment arm and prior adjuvant treatment was 
identified.
CONCLUSIONS: No statistically significant difference in either OS or PFS by 
biologic agent was found in this unplanned subset analysis of two large, 
randomized phase III trials. However, further investigation is warranted to 
evaluate possible survival differences in larger patient cohorts.

BACKGROUND: With progressive accumulation of knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 infection 
clinical management, treatment guidelines recommended several options including 
remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral. Given the evolving nature of coronavirus 
disease 2019, capturing the totality of scientific evidence from clinical trials 
and observational studies is critical to inform clinical decision making. We 
conducted a systematic literature review with meta-analysis to summarize the 
effectiveness of remdesivir among hospitalized adults.
METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library 
databases for interventional and observational studies examining remdesivir 
efficacy. A rigorous double-reviewer approach was used for source 
identification, screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. A 
hierarchical random-effects model meta-analysis was used, with subgroup analyses 
for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and real-world (RW) studies.
RESULTS: From January 2019 to December 2023 >18 000 sources were screened, and 
122 unique studies were identified, reporting on 25 174 participants in RCTs and 
1 279 859 in RW studies. Remdesivir significantly increased survival in the 
overall population (odds ratio, 0.69 [95% confidence interval, .55-.86]; P = 
.001] across SARS-CoV-2 variants and disease severity levels: no supplemental 
oxygen (0.81 [.75-.88]), low-flow oxygen (0.71 [.64-.79]), high-flow oxygen 
(0.87 [.83-.91]), and invasive mechanical ventilation (0.78 [.68-.90]). 
Rehospitalization risk was significantly reduced in patients receiving 
remdesivir (odds ratio, 0.72 [95% confidence interval, .64-.81]).
CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive systematic literature review, capturing the 
totality of evidence, showed a significant survival benefit among patients 
hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection and receiving remdesivir, across all 
disease severity levels. To assure that healthcare providers are aware of and 
deploy evidence-based optimal care, recommendations should rely on both RCT and 
RW data.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: As a renally-eliminated beta-lactam antibiotic, 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a central component of 
piperacillin/tazobactam pharmacokinetics. This study aimed to determine the 
optimal eGFR equation for inclusion in population pharmacokinetic models for 
piperacillin and tazobactam among critically ill adults.
METHODS: The study included critically ill adults treated with 
piperacillin/tazobactam at a single academic medical center between 2018 and 
2022. Excluded individuals had acute kidney injury, received kidney replacement 
therapy, or had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at piperacillin/tazobactam 
initiation. Non-linear mixed effects population pharmacokinetic models using 
eGFR equations with creatinine, cystatin C, or both were developed and compared.
RESULTS: Using 377 samples from 120 critically ill patients, we found that a 
two-compartment model with first-order elimination best fit the piperacillin 
data and a one-compartment model with first-order elimination best fit the 
tazobactam data. For piperacillin, the final population mean parameters 
(standard error) were 8.36 (0.55) L/h for CL and 12.96 (1.17) L for V1. The 
values for Q and V2 were fixed at 0.98 L/h and 18 L, respectively, due to low 
interindividual variation in these parameters. For tazobactam, the final 
population mean parameters were 8.12 (0.52) L/h for CL and 16.87 (1.44) L for V. 
Both final models identified eGFRcystatinC expressed in mL/min as the eGFR 
equation that best predicted drug clearance as a covariate.
CONCLUSIONS: An eGFR equation that includes cystatin C improves the predictive 
performance of pharmacokinetic models for piperacillin/tazobactam in critically 
ill adults.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 
RA) agents differ with respect to the risk of developing sight-threatening 
diabetic retinopathy complications in patients with type 2 diabetes at moderate 
cardiovascular risk.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study under the target trial 
emulation framework involving adult (≥21 years) enrollees in U.S. commercial, 
Medicare Advantage, and Medicare fee-for-service plans from 1/1/2014-12/31/2022. 
The study population included adults with type 2 diabetes, moderate 
cardiovascular disease risk, no baseline advanced diabetic retinopathy, and 
minimum 1 year enrollment prior to GLP-1 RA treatment. Due to differences in 
GLP-1 RA agent use over time, we performed both a 3-way comparison of patients 
initiating liraglutide, dulaglutide, or exenatide from 1/1/2015-12/31/2021, and 
a 2-way comparison of patients initiating semaglutide or dulaglutide between 
1/1/2019-12/31/2021. We assessed differences in complications using inverse 
propensity score weighted Cox proportional hazards models with the primary 
outcome of treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME) and/or proliferative 
diabetic retinopathy (PDR).
RESULTS: When comparing patients who initiated treatment with exenatide 
(n=14,076, median follow-up 969 days [IQR 578-1444]), to those starting 
dulaglutide (n=54,787, median follow-up 948 days [IQR 551-1457]) or liraglutide 
(n=25,562, median follow-up 1007 days [IQR 575-1494]), no differences were found 
in the hazard (HR, 95% CI) of composite treatment for DME and/or PDR: exenatide 
vs. dulaglutide (HR 0.90, 0.73-1.12), liraglutide vs. dulaglutide (HR 0.97, 
0.79-1.19), or liraglutide vs. exenatide (HR 1.08, 0.83-1.38), nor were 
differences found in any comparisons for treatment of DME (HR 0.93, 0.74-1.18; 
HR 0.99, 0.79-1.24; HR 1.06, 0.80-1.40) or PDR individually (HR 1.16, 0.81-1.67; 
HR 1.05, 0.73-1.51; HR 0.91, 0.58-1.40). Likewise, when comparing patients 
initiating semaglutide (n=30,911, median follow-up 625 days [IQR 455-850]) vs. 
dulaglutide (n=32,844, median follow-up 639 days [IQR 459-878]), the hazards 
(HR, 95% CI) for treatment of DME and/or PDR (HR 0.88, 0.70-1.11), DME (HR 0.89, 
0.69-1.14), and PDR (HR 0.70, 0.45-1.09) all found no difference between drugs.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the differences in systemic efficacy among the examined 
GLP-1 RAs, we identified no difference in the risk of sight-threatening diabetic 
retinopathy following initiation of different GLP-1 RA agents among adults with 
type 2 diabetes at moderate cardiovascular risk.

BACKGROUND: Flow-related ghost artifact from a 3D Magnetization Prepared Rapid 
Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) sequence results from unsaturated magnetization of 
incoming arterial flow. This is especially common on MR scanners equipped with 
smaller radiofrequency (RF) transmit coils. A high-performance compact 3T (C3T) 
scanner features a smaller RF-transmit coil (inner diameter 37 cm, length 
40 cm), leading to a rapid fall-off of the B1 field below the neck. This 
configuration results in more intense flow-related ghost artifacts, especially 
in younger patients.
PURPOSE: The C3T scanner's smaller RF-transmit coil provides RF field coverage 
over the brain region, causing bright in-flow arterial signals and flow-related 
artifacts in the conventional 3D-MPRAGE scans. The purpose of this study is to 
suppress these artifacts by adding a RF saturation band (RFSB) pulses to the 
3D-MPRAGE sequence.
METHODS: The RFSB was added to the 3D-MPRAGE sequence as a preparation pulse 
option. To test the effectiveness, 37 subjects were scanned on the C3T under an 
IRB-approved protocol using 3D-MPRAGE with and without RFSB. Ten of those 
subjects underwent repeated scans with and without RFSB to evaluate test-retest 
reliability. A consensus evaluation by two neuroradiologists was performed on 
all data to compare signal to noise ratio, image contrast, presence of 
artifacts, and diagnostic confidence. Quantitative analysis included calculating 
test-retest differences by image subtraction and evaluating the variance in 
flow-artifact-induced image intensity between the scans with and without RFSB. 
Additionally, one subject was scanned on a whole-body 3T scanner using a 
transmit/receive (T/R) head coil to demonstrate the method's applicability 
across different MRI platforms as a proof of concept.
RESULTS: The Wilcoxon signed-rank test of the neuroradiologist evaluations 
showed a significant reduction in artifacts and an improvement in diagnostic 
confidence in the posterior fossa region with and without RFSB (p < 0.0001). 
Test-retest analysis showed that adding RFSB significantly reduced image 
intensity variability in the cerebellum, even among subjects without visible 
flow artifacts. The normalized difference decreased from 8.71% to 6.41% 
(p = 0.0059), suggesting improved image reliability in regions prone to 
flow-related artifacts. Additionally, similar findings were observed in scans on 
a whole-body 3T with a T/R head coil, demonstrating the broader applicability of 
this method.
CONCLUSION: Incorporating RFSB into 3D-MPRAGE scans effectively reduces 
flow-related ghost artifact on the C3T scanner, improving image quality and 
diagnostic confidence. These findings suggest that the proposed method could be 
widely implemented across MRI systems utilizing a smaller RF-transmit coil.

This study aimed to distinguish between essential thrombocythemia (ET) and 
prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (pre-PMF) using routine blood tests, with a 
focus on white blood cell (WBC) and platelet (PLT) levels. We evaluated the 
predicted probability of a pre-PMF diagnosis based on the interaction between 
WBC and PLT levels using data from a logistic regression model involving 891 
patients with ET and 180 patients with pre-PMF. Patients were divided into four 
groups based on whether their WBC and PLT values were below or above the 
respective thresholds of 8.85 × 109/L and 793 × 109/L. The results showed that 
patients with low levels of both WBCs and PLTs had the lowest predicted 
probability of pre-PMF (6%), indicating a profile more typical of ET. When 
either WBC or PLT levels were elevated, the probability increased to 
approximately 18%-19%, indicating a potential shift toward pre-PMF features. 
Notably, patients with elevated levels of both WBCs and PLTs had the highest 
probability of a pre-PMF diagnosis (26%), which was more than four times higher 
than that of the low-low group. The association between combined WBC/PLT levels 
and a pre-PMF diagnosis remained significant (p < 0.001), even when adjusting 
for serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and splenomegaly. These findings suggest 
that elevated WBC and PLT levels together can serve as a practical and 
accessible diagnostic tool for supporting the differential diagnosis of ET or 
pre-PMF in cases of uncertainty, and for deferring bone marrow biopsy in cases 
of early disease presenting with isolated thrombocytosis.

BACKGROUND: Malignant mesenchymal tumors involving the parotid gland are 
uncommon, characteristically aggressive, and little is known with few reports 
documented.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
SETTING: Single institution tertiary care center, 2010 to 2022.
METHOD: Patients were identified from an institutional parotid tumor database. 
Patient history, demographics, pathologic diagnosis, treatment, and follow up 
were documented.
RESULTS: Eight patients were identified, 3 were males. The average age was 
61 years old, and the most common tumors identified were pleomorphic sarcomas (3 
patients). Presenting symptoms included: preauricular/cheek mass in 7 patients, 
facial pain (4), otalgia (4), aural fullness (3), and numbness (1). All patients 
received a parotidectomy, and 4 patients received adjuvant therapy of either 
radiation or chemoradiation. Post-operatively, there were 3 cases of distant 
recurrence, 2 cases of regional recurrence, and 1 case of local recurrence. 
There were 2 reports of death.
CONCLUSION: Malignant mesenchymal tumors of the parotid are rare, represent 
varied histologies. Due to their aggressive nature, surgical resection with 
radiation and close follow-up may be an appropriate treatment regimen in 
controlling the disease.

The International Consensus Conference "Optimising Performance of the Elite 
Athlete," held in November 2024, brought together 29 scientists, some coaches, 
and athletes to establish evidence-based consensus statements aimed at enhancing 
elite athletic performance and health. The conference addressed critical themes 
including training strategies, nutrition, female athlete considerations, injury 
management, and emerging technologies. Key conclusions emphasize individualized, 
sport-specific approaches to training and nutrition, integrating concurrent 
training modalities to improve endurance, resilience, and efficiency. Nutrition 
strategies highlight the importance of tailored energy and macronutrient 
periodization, recognition of low energy availability risks, and cautious use of 
dietary supplements. Special attention was directed to female athletes, 
advocating for improved monitoring of menstrual cycles and hormonal status, 
while acknowledging current knowledge gaps in hormonal influences on performance 
and injury risk. Injury prevention remains a challenge, with tendon overuse and 
Achilles tendon ruptures significantly impacting athlete careers; rehabilitation 
should rely on criteria-based progression and multidisciplinary input. Emerging 
technologies, including wearable sensors and multi-omics analyses, hold promise 
for personalized training and nutrition but require further validation in elite 
contexts. Despite robust consensus, the panel identified substantial research 
gaps, particularly regarding female athletes, longitudinal training effects, and 
efficacy of novel interventions. This consensus provides a practical, 
scientifically grounded framework to optimize elite athlete performance and 
health, while underscoring the need for continued research to address 
outstanding questions and promote inclusive evidence-based practices.

BACKGROUND: The isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a key 
molecular marker in diagnosing and treating brain tumors. Currently, it is 
determined via invasive tissue biopsy. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) 
have offered promising non-invasive alternatives for determining IDH status. 
However, their clinical translation is hindered by a significant gap between DL 
predictions and their clinical applicability. The limited transparency of many 
DL-networks and inadequate evaluation metrics hinders trust and adoption, as 
clinicians require clear and validated insights for determining IDH status. 
These challenges highlight the need for robust validation and measures of 
predictive reliability to make DL-predictions clinically actionable.
METHODS: We developed a unique approach for non-invasive prediction of IDH 
status using MRI. We combine a voxel-wise-segmentation network(MC-net) with 
Bayesian logistic regression (BLR) to provide an IDH status and estimate 
confidence scores. We utilized a comprehensive dataset of 2,481 glioma cases 
from eight institutions.
RESULTS: Our framework(MC-net + BLR) demonstrated robust performance achieving 
96.4% and 95.1% classification accuracies on diverse databases, with an AUC of 
0.98. The BLR was implemented exclusively on held-out test data, ensuring that 
the derived confidence scores are independent of the training or validation 
phases. The derived confidence scores showed a low Brier score of 0.0125, 
highlighting its superior calibration and uncertainty quantification.
CONCLUSION: The developed framework provides an IDH status and a confidence 
score, offering clinicians an additional layer of assurance in prediction 
reliability. It bridges the gap between high-performing DL models and their 
clinical applicability by addressing the challenges in prediction reliability. 
Our framework is a significant advancement in non-invasive determination of 
IDH-status and confidence-informed therapeutic decision-making in 
neuro-oncology.

BACKGROUND: The Society of Pediatric Liver Transplantation (SPLIT) has undergone 
tremendous growth with > 45 sites contributing data focusing on improving 
outcomes in pediatric liver transplantation (LT). We report and compare outcomes 
from the SPLIT Registry.
METHODS: Patients < 18 years with first-time LT only enrolled into the SPLIT 
Registry between 2011 and 2023 were included. Data was stratified into eras from 
the last published registry update (era 1: 2011-2018, era 2: 2018-2023).
RESULTS: Three thousand five hundred four participants from 47 centers were 
included (era 1: n = 2159; era 2: n = 1345). Age distribution differed with more 
children < 1 year. of age at LT in era 2 (era 1: 29% vs. era 2: 33%, p = 0.01). 
Indications for LT were similar, with biliary atresia (38.8%) and metabolic 
disease (16.0%) being most common. Exception point use was higher in era 2 (era 
1: 45% vs. era 2: 56%, p < 0.001). No difference in graft type (deceased: 81% 
era 1 vs. 78% era 2, p = 0.78), patient survival at 90 days (era 1: 98.7% vs. 
era 2: 98.3%), 1 year (era 1: 97.2 vs. era 2: 96.8%), or 3 years (era 1: 95.3% 
vs. era 2: 95.2%) was noted. Rate of hepatic artery thrombosis was lower in era 
2 (era 1: 7% vs. era 2: 5%, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: Trends in pediatric LT within SPLIT note similar LT indications and 
graft type, higher utilization of exception points, and lower HAT rates despite 
transplanting more children < 10 kg. This data underscores the evolution of 
pediatric LT toward higher survivability and overall patient outcomes.

Introduction: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) has been a mainstay treatment 
for large stone burdens since the 1980s, historically offering improved 
stone-free rates over retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). Gaining optimal 
access into the renal collecting system can be challenging, requiring advanced 
skills or interventional radiology assistance. The learning curve for 
fluoroscopic and ultrasonography access can be steep, with only a minority of 
PCNL access performed by urologists in the United States. This study compares 
robotic-assisted electromagnetic (EM) guidance to traditional fluoroscopy for 
obtaining percutaneous renal access between cohorts of novice and expert 
urologists. Methods: Ten novices and five expert urologists used 
robotic-assisted EM guidance to obtain access in a modified supine position 
compared with using fluoroscopy in a traditional prone position in human 
cadavers. Primary success was defined as papillary access. Performance metrics, 
including number of puncture attempts, time to access, radiation exposure, and 
participant confidence, were compared between novices and experts. Results: 
Robotic-assisted EM guidance improved success rates for both novices (100% vs 
70%) and experts (93% vs 87%) compared with fluoroscopy. Novices showed greater 
accuracy using robotic assistance (97% vs 37%). The number of insertion attempts 
decreased with robotic guidance for both groups (novices: 3.42 ± 0.44 vs 
1.47 ± 0.19; experts: 2.13 ± 0.36 vs 1.40 ± 0.24; p < 0.002). EM guidance (p < 
0.05) and experience (p < 0.05) significantly reduced the time from needle 
insertion to access (novices: 12.86 ± 2.41 minutes vs 4.49 ± 0.96 minutes; 
experts: 4.90 ± 1.40 minutes vs 4.09 ± 1.12 minutes). Radiation exposure was 
notably lower with EM guidance (novices, 1.12 ± 0.17 mGy vs 4.86 ± 0.70 mGy; 
experts, 0.69 ± 0.12 mGy vs 4.11 ± 1.21 mGy; p < 0.001). Novices felt more 
confident (5[3-5] vs 2[1-4], p < 0.001) and at ease (5[3-5] vs 2.75[1-3], p < 
0.001) with EM guidance. Conclusion: Robotic-assisted EM guidance improves 
percutaneous access success, reduces attempts and radiation exposure, and 
enhances novice confidence and accuracy. This technology could enable urologists 
to more effectively and safely perform PCNL, especially for less experienced 
practitioners.

PURPOSE: Ultra-low field MRI scanners have the potential to improve health care 
delivery, both through improved access in areas where there are few MRI scanners 
and allowing more frequent monitoring of disease progression and treatment 
response. This may be particularly true in white matter disorders, including 
leukodystrophies and multiple sclerosis, in which frequent myelin-sensitive 
imaging, such as magnetization transfer (MT) imaging, might improve clinical 
care and patient outcomes.
METHODS: We implemented an on-resonance approach to MT imaging on a commercial 
point-of-care 64 mT scanner using a non-balanced steady-state free precession 
sequence. Phantom and in vivo experiments were used to evaluate and optimize the 
sequence sensitivity and reproducibility, and to demonstrate in vivo performance 
and inter-site reproducibility.
RESULTS: From phantom experiments, T1 and T2 effects were determined to have a 
negligible effect on the differential MT weighting. MT ratio (MTR) values in 
white matter were 23.1 ± 1.0% from 10 healthy volunteers, with an average 
reproducibility coefficient of variation of 1.04%. Normal-appearing white matter 
MTR values in a multiple sclerosis participant (21.5 ± 6.2%) were lower, but 
with a similar spread of values, compared to an age-matched healthy volunteer 
(23.3 ± 6.2%).
CONCLUSION: An on-resonance MT imaging approach was developed at 64 mT that can 
be performed in as little as 4 min. A semi-quantitative myelin-sensitive imaging 
biomarker at this field strength is available for assessing both myelination and 
demyelination.

BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predisposes individuals to frailty, 
linked with adverse outcomes. While the Fried Frailty Index (FFI) is a 
well-established phenotypic tool to assess frailty, its administration is 
cumbersome. The FRAIL scale, simpler but not widely used in patients with IBD, 
presents an alternative. We aimed to assess the prevalence of frailty and 
compare the FRAIL scale with the FFI.
METHODS: A cohort of patients with IBD underwent assessment using both the FFI 
and the FRAIL scale. Patients were categorized as non-frail, pre-frail, or 
frail. The primary outcome was frailty prevalence, while secondary outcomes 
included comparison of FFI and FRAIL scale and associations between frailty and 
disease-related factors. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests, ANOVA, 
Kruskal-Wallis tests, and ROC curve analysis using SPSS v27, with p < 0.05 
indicating significance.
RESULTS: Among participants (53.5% female, median age 44), 37% were non-frail, 
50% pre-frail, and 13% frail. The FRAIL scale exhibited strong correlation with 
the FFI for all three categories. Age showed no significant association with 
frailty. Frail individuals displayed higher inflammatory markers and more severe 
clinical disease, with frailty more prevalent in patients with UC than CD. Frail 
individuals also exhibited lower hemoglobin, creatinine, and albumin levels.
CONCLUSION: Frailty and pre-frailty are prevalent in patients with IBD and not 
necessarily linked with older age. The FRAIL scale demonstrated excellent 
correlation with the FFI, offering a practical tool for identifying frailty in 
IBD without physical measurements. Future studies should explore multivariable 
models incorporating frailty risk factors and interventions to mitigate adverse 
outcomes in patients with IBD.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 70% of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease (COPD) remain undiagnosed. Opportunistic screening using chest computed 
tomography (CT) scans, commonly acquired in clinical practice, may be used to 
improve COPD detection through simple, clinically applicable deep-learning 
models. We developed a lightweight, convolutional neural network (COPDxNet) that 
utilizes minimally processed chest CT scans to detect COPD.
METHODS: We analyzed 13,043 inspiratory chest CT scans from the COPDGene 
participants, (9,675 standard-dose and 3,368 low-dose scans), which we randomly 
split into training (70%) and test (30%) sets at the participant level to no 
individual contributed to both sets. COPD was defined by postbronchodilator FEV 
/FVC < 0.70. We constructed a simple, four-block convolutional model that was 
trained on pooled data and validated on the held-out standard- and low-dose test 
sets. External validation was performed using standard-dose CT scans from 2,890 
SPIROMICS participants and low-dose CT scans from 7,893 participants in the 
National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). We evaluated performance using the area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, 
specificity, Brier scores, and calibration curves.
FINDINGS: On COPDGene standard-dose CT scans, COPDxNet achieved an AUC of 0.92 
(95% CI: 0.91 to 0.93), sensitivity of 80.2%, and specificity of 89.4%. On 
low-dose scans, AUC was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.86 to 0.90). When the COPDxNet model was 
applied to external validation datasets, it showed an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91 
to 0.93) in SPIROMICS and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.81 to 0.83) on NLST. The model was 
well-calibrated, with Brier scores of 0.11 for standard-dose and 0.13 for 
low-dose CT scans in COPDGene, 0.12 in SPIROMICS, and 0.17 in NLST.
INTERPRETATION: COPDxNet demonstrates high discriminative accuracy and 
generalizability for detecting COPD on standard- and low-dose chest CT scans, 
supporting its potential for clinical and screening applications across diverse 
populations.

AIMS: Significant advancements have been made in the management of obstructive 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (oHCM), yet the extent of left ventricular outflow 
tract (LVOT) gradient reduction achieved with commonly used pharmacological 
therapies [beta-blockers (BBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), disopyramide, 
and cardiac myosin inhibitors (CMIs)] relative to each other is still unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed and Scopus were searched up to September 2024. 
Clinical trials or observational studies that assessed the changes associated 
with BBs, CCBs, disopyramide, or CMIs in LVOT gradient at rest or with 
provocation in patients with oHCM were included. Mean changes in LVOT gradients 
were pooled as mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in a 
random-effects model. Thirty-seven studies, with 44 arms and 1898 patients, were 
included in the analysis. At the therapeutic class level, pooled analysis showed 
that disopyramide was associated with the highest reduction in LVOT gradient at 
rest [MD: -43.5 (95% CI, -51.6 to -35.3)], followed by CMIs [MD: -34.8 (95% CI, 
-40.6 to -29.0)], BBs [MD: -20.7 (95% CI, -29.4 to -12.0)], and then CCBs [MD: 
-14.7 (95% CI, -23.3 to -6.1)], inter-action P < 0.01. Within CMIs, mavacamten 
had a higher effect than aficamten on gradient reduction; among the included 
BBs, metoprolol showed the highest gradient reduction, while among CCBs, 
verapamil was the most effective (inter-action P < 0.01). Similar results were 
observed for provocable LVOT gradients.
CONCLUSION: Pharmacological therapies effectively reduced LVOT gradients in oHCM 
patients to varying degrees, with disopyramide and CMIs showing the highest 
effect, followed by BBs and CCBs.

BACKGROUND: Managing idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) during pregnancy 
presents distinct clinical challenges. As pregnancy is a naturally dyspneic 
state, the development of iSGS may exacerbate respiratory symptoms and 
compromise the airway-potentially impacting pregnancy and delivery decisions. 
This study characterizes surgical management strategies and outcomes in pregnant 
patients with symptomatic iSGS.
METHODS: We conducted the largest known multi-institutional retrospective review 
of pregnant patients who underwent endoscopic intervention for iSGS. 
Demographics, procedural details, anesthesia and medication use, and maternal 
and neonatal outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Twelve patients underwent 15 endoscopic procedures during pregnancy: 9 
laser wedge excisions (8 CO2 laser and 1 coblator) and 6 balloon dilations. 
Three additional procedures in different patients occurred postpartum 
(2-11 months after delivery). Higher-risk pregnancies included two twin 
gestations, one patient with multiple surgeries during two different 
pregnancies, and two patients over age 35. Most interventions (87%) occurred in 
the second trimester. Fetal monitoring was performed preoperatively and 
postoperatively. Fentanyl and propofol were used in 88% and 94% of cases, 
respectively; rocuronium was the most common neuromuscular blocker (70%). One 
patient underwent balloon dilation via flexible bronchoscopy without anesthesia. 
Jet ventilation was used in 53% of cases, and Size C Kleinsasser laryngoscopes 
in 47%. Median procedure times were 75, 19, and 18 min for laser wedge excision, 
balloon dilation, and coblation, respectively. Most patients delivered full-term 
with no surgical or postpartum complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic intervention for iSGS during pregnancy appears safe and 
effective, even in high-risk cases. These findings support individualized airway 
management and inform future practice.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the impact of parity on the severity and 
recurrence rates of idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) in premenopausal 
females.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Two tertiary care centers from 2002 to 2024.
METHODS: We analyzed premenopausal iSGS patients under 40 years who underwent 
balloon dilation or laser wedge excision. Clinical features, including 
demographics and pregnancy history, were examined. Recurrence rates between 
nulliparous and parous patients were compared using Poisson regression, 
adjusting for age and follow-up duration. Linear regression assessed the 
relationship between pregnancy and iSGS recurrence.
RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included, with 36 parous and 12 nulliparous. 
Adjusting for age and follow-up, the mean recurrence rate was 2.6 times higher 
in parous patients (95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.5, 4.8], P = .0008). Each 
additional pregnancy was associated with 0.81 additional recurrences (95% CI: 
[0.05, 1.57], P = .0375). No significant differences in surgery-free time were 
observed between groups.
CONCLUSION: Parity and pregnancy significantly increase the risk of iSGS 
recurrence, although they do not accelerate subsequent recurrences. Health care 
providers should counsel women of childbearing age about these risks in family 
planning discussions, emphasizing shared decision-making regarding potential 
surgical interventions.

Despite significant improvements in survival of patients with multiple myeloma 
(MM), outcomes remain heterogeneous, and a significant proportion of patients 
experience suboptimal outcomes. Importantly, traditional prognostic factors 
based on data from patients treated with older therapies no longer capture 
prognosis accurately in the contemporary era of novel triplet or quadruplet 
therapies. Therefore, risk stratification requires refinement in the context of 
available and investigational treatment options in routine practice and clinical 
trials, respectively. The current identification of high-risk MM (HRMM) in 
routine practice is based on the Revised International Staging System, which 
stratifies patients using a combination of widely available serum biomarkers and 
chromosomal abnormalities assessed via fluorescence in situ hybridization. In 
recent years, a substantial body of evidence concerning additional clinical, 
biological, and molecular/genomic prognostic factors has accumulated, along with 
new MM risk stratification tools and consensus reports. The International 
Myeloma Society, along with the International Myeloma Working Group, convened an 
Expert Panel with the primary aim of revisiting the definition of HRMM and 
formulating a practical and data-driven consensus definition, based on new 
evidence from molecular/genomic assays, updated clinical data, and contemporary 
risk stratification concepts. The Panel proposes the following Consensus Genomic 
Staging (CGS) of HRMM which relies upon the presence of at least one of these 
abnormalities: (1) del(17p), with a cutoff of >20% clonal fraction, and/or TP53 
mutation; (2) an IgH translocation including t(4;14), t(14;16), or t(14;20) 
along with 1q+ and/or del(1p32); (3) monoallelic del(1p32) along with 1q+ or 
biallelic del(1p32); or (4) β2 microglobulin ≥5.5 mg/L with normal creatinine 
(<1.2 mg/dL).

OBJECTIVES: To study whether a history of premenopausal bilateral oophorectomy 
(PBO) may influence circulating concentrations of cellular senescence biomarkers 
and their associations with measures of physical and cognitive function later in 
life.
STUDY DESIGN: The plasma concentrations of 29 candidate senescence biomarkers 
and parameters of physical and cognitive function were measured in 510 older 
women, comprising 273 with a history of PBO and 237 referents.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma concentrations of senescence biomarkers and their 
associations with measures of physical and cognitive function.
RESULTS: In participants with a history of PBO compared to referents, only the 
plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and tumor necrosis factor 
receptor 2 (TNFR2) were statistically significantly higher than they were in the 
referent group, whereas matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) was lower. Overall, 
measures of physical and cognitive function did not differ between those with 
and without PBO. In an exploratory analysis, several senescence-related 
biomarkers were associated with chronological age, body mass index, and measures 
of physical function, including 6-minute walk distance and muscle strength and 
power. Only few biomarkers were associated with measures of cognitive function. 
Using machine learning, subsets of biomarkers in combination with demographic 
and clinical covariates exhibited higher value than the covariates alone in 
predicting most of the physical and cognitive function outcomes in 
cross-sectional analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: The circulating concentrations of several candidate senescence 
biomarkers were associated with physical and cognitive function in a cohort of 
older women, but only a few biomarkers differed between participants with a 
history of PBO and referents. Additional research is needed to better understand 
the influence of PBO on the biology of aging.

BACKGROUND: Social media (SM) has emerged as a tool for health-related usage 
among US adults, including cancer screening promotion. Here, we aimed to assess 
the differences in health-related SM use between US and foreign-born adults and 
the relationship between health-related SM use and colorectal (CRC) screening 
practices.
METHODS: Using data from the fifth edition of the National Cancer Institute's 
Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5), cycle 2, we compared the 
differences in health-related SM use between US and foreign-born adults and the 
effects of SM use on CRC screening by country of birth. We included adults aged 
50-75 and excluded participants with a history of CRC. The primary endpoint was 
CRC screening, which was determined by self-reported CRC screening using 
colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or stool occult blood testing.
RESULTS: Our study included 1,812 adults, of whom 236 (13.0%) were foreign-born. 
Most participants (72.1%) reported undergoing CRC screening. Interestingly, we 
found no discernible difference in health-related SM use [odds ratio [OR] 0.91; 
95% CI (0.49, 1.69)] between US and foreign-born adults. Furthermore, our 
analysis revealed that SM use did not influence CRC screening practices among 
either group (US-born: 0.88 [95% CI: 0.50, 1.52], foreign-born 0.52 [0.10, 
2.51]).
CONCLUSION: Contrary to previous studies, which showed a positive relationship 
between SM use and satisfactory health-related practices, we found that although 
foreign-born adults use SM as much as US-born adults, there was no significant 
relationship between SM use and CRC screening.

Non-DLBCL Monomorphic and Hodgkin Lymphoma PTLD: Clinical Insights and Treatment 
Strategies.

Monomorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) beyond diffuse 
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are rare, biologically heterogeneous entities with 
limited prospective data to guide treatment. DLBCL-PTLD, which comprises the 
majority of cases, is managed using approaches informed by prospective phase 2 
studies, including reduction in immunosuppression (RIS) and a risk-adapted 
sequential chemoimmunotherapy (RSST) approach. In contrast, non-DLBCL subtypes 
such as Burkitt lymphoma, T and NK cell PTLD, and plasmacytic variants are less 
common and are typically treated using strategies extrapolated from established 
treatment algorithms used in immunocompetent patients and sporadic case reports. 
Classic Hodgkin lymphoma PTLD, although not classified as monomorphic, 
represents another distinct and clinically relevant subtype. This review 
summarizes the epidemiology, clinical features, treatment strategies, and 
outcomes associated with these less common PTLDs, aiming to provide a practical 
framework for their management.

Faecal incontinence is a debilitating anorectal disorder that can severely 
affect a person's quality of life. The variability in reported outcomes in 
studies on treatments for faecal incontinence complicates the synthesis of 
evidence, thereby weakening treatment recommendations. Furthermore, the emphasis 
on clinical outcomes often neglects outcomes that are crucial to patients' daily 
lives. Incorporating diverse stakeholder perspectives, we aimed to develop a 
core outcome set (COS)-a minimum set of outcomes that should be measured in 
future studies evaluating the efficacy of a treatment in adults with faecal 
incontinence. Following guidelines from the COMET initiative, this study 
proceeded through three steps: identifying outcomes via patient interviews and a 
systematic literature review; ranking and refining outcomes through two rounds 
of Delphi surveys involving patients, health-care professionals, and 
researchers; and finalising the COS through a consensus meeting with relevant 
stakeholders. Round 1 of the Delphi survey included 109 participants (73 
health-care professionals and researchers and 36 patients) and round 2 involved 
74 participants (54 and 20, respectively). In both rounds, participants ranked 
the importance of potential outcomes on a 9-point Likert scale. Of the 58 
outcomes that entered round 1 and the three that were later added, 27 outcomes 
were voted out and the remaining 34 were discussed during a consensus meeting to 
finalise the COS. The final COS encompasses 13 outcomes: seven quality of 
life-related outcomes (quality of life, influence on daily activities, social 
functioning, treatment satisfaction, enjoyment in life, embarrassment, and peace 
of mind) and six clinical outcomes (severity of faecal incontinence, number of 
faecal incontinence episodes, urgency, stool consistency, adverse events, and 
adherence to therapy). This study establishes what outcomes should be included 
in a COS for use in faecal incontinence research, but future research is needed 
to identify the appropriate measurement instruments for each outcome and to 
establish appropriate timing for their assessment, which will further refine 
outcome definitions before this COS can be implemented. Once these aspects are 
clarified, the COS can be adopted into faecal incontinence research, which we 
hope will ultimately improve clinical care.

Clonus is a disabling symptom of upper motor neuron dysfunction in patients with 
multiple sclerosis (MS). We report immediate termination of mechanically evoked 
clonus by epidural lumbosacral spinal cord stimulation (ES) in a 58-year-old man 
with secondary progressive MS. This observation was captured during training 
using video and skin surface electromyography of soleus muscle activity. ES 
immediately reduced mechanically evoked clonus duration and cycle count compared 
to trials without stimulation, as determined by a Kruskal-Wallis test (p < 0.05, 
n = 2-3 trials), and reverted to baseline status when stimulation was off.

Uniform assessment of response to treatment is crucial to managing multiple 
myeloma (MM) and developing new therapies. Measurement of monoclonal protein 
forms the cornerstone of disease assessment in MM. According to International 
Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) guidelines, serum-free light chain (sFLC) is 
included in MM response assessment in patients with no measurable disease by 
electrophoresis and to define stringent complete response. We retrospectively 
analyzed the independent value of serial FLC on response and progression 
assessments in 839 patients with measurable disease by sFLC as well as 
serum/urine electrophoresis. A significant association was observed between sFLC 
and electrophoretic responses during initial therapy and at best response 
(p < 0.001). This study revealed comparable percentage changes in serial dFLC 
and urine M-protein, with parallel trends (p < 0.001) and strong correlations (r 
0.55-0.79, p < 0.001). The response was detected earlier by sFLC (1.1 months, 
95% CI 1.06-1.17), and sFLC ≥ PR after two cycles of induction demonstrated a 
strong predictive value for subsequent electrophoresis responses (OR 9.33, 
p < 0.001). Following induction, no difference in PFS was observed between very 
good partial response (VGPR) as determined by sFLC, sPEP, and uPEP (p = 0.538). 
The median second-PFS for patients with only sFLC-progression disease (PD) was 
similar to those with urine M-protein PD with or without sFLC-PD (HR 1.28, 95% 
CI 0.77-2.13, p 0.334). However, the median overall survival from the first 
relapse was significantly better for patients with only sFLC-PD (HR 1.87, 95% CI 
1.07-3.27, p 0.03). Among patients with PD, 12% had sFLC as the only detectable 
tumor marker at the time of second-line therapy. This study supports the 
incorporation of serial sFLC measurements for monitoring response and 
progression in MM, even in patients with electrophoretic measurable disease, and 
further advocates replacing 24-h urine with serial sFLC in response assessment.

BACKGROUND: Cholestatic liver diseases, including primary sclerosing 
cholangitis, are characterized by biliary fibroinflammation. TGFβ-activated 
cholangiocytes release signals that recruit immune cells and activate 
myofibroblasts, promoting inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) 
deposition. TGFβ also regulates stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), an enzyme 
involved in lipid signaling. Yet, the role of SCD or its inhibitor, Aramchol, in 
biliary fibroinflammation had not been studied.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Mdr2-/- with established biliary fibrosis and 
3,5-diethoxycarboncyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet-fed mice were treated with 
Aramchol meglumine (12.5 mg/kg/day). Hepatic fibrosis was assessed by qPCR, 
Picrosirius red staining, immunofluorescence, and hydroxyproline content. Human 
H69 or murine large cholangiocyte cell lines stimulated with TGFβ, as well as 
PSC-derived cholangiocytes (PSC-C), were treated with Aramchol or SCD siRNA. 
RNA-seq, fibroinflammatory marker expression, peroxisome proliferator-activated 
receptor (PPAR) activity, and targeted fatty acid profiling were performed. 
Aramchol treatment significantly reduced hepatic ECM gene expression, 
inflammatory cytokines (Il6,Tnfa), collagen content, and myofibroblast 
activation (aSMA staining) in both mouse models. In TGFβ-stimulated H69 cells, 
Aramchol suppressed hepatic fibrosis pathways and enhanced PPAR signaling. 
Aramchol also reduced the expression of fibrotic markers, 
myofibroblast-activating mediators (VEGFA and PDGFB), and IL6, mirroring the 
effects of SCD knockdown. In PSC-C, Aramchol significantly downregulated SCD, 
VEGFA and IL6. Conversely, PPARα and -γ activity and fatty acid agonist, 
linoleic acid levels were increased in cholangiocyte cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: Aramchol attenuates and prevents biliary fibrosis in mouse models 
of cholestatic liver disease by inhibiting TGFβ-induced fibroinflammatory 
mediators and activating PPARa/γ in cholangiocytes. These findings, combined 
with its favorable clinical safety profile, support the potential of Aramchol as 
a therapeutic candidate for PSC.

BackgroundDementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common degenerative dementia, but 
no studies investigate bereaved caregiver experiences.ObjectiveTo investigate 
the experiences of caregivers three months after the death of persons with DLB 
using a mixed-methods approach.MethodsDyads of individuals with 
moderate-advanced DLB and their primary informal caregivers were followed 
prospectively every 6 months until the person with DLB died. Caregivers 
completed a study visit with questionnaires and a semi-structured interview ∼3 
months later. Spearman correlation coefficients and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests 
evaluated the relationships of post-death measures with pre-death patient and 
caregiver variables. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the 
interviews.ResultsSeventy-three caregivers completed visits (mean 3.5 months 
post-death). Most of the caregivers were women (82.2%) and spouses (76.7%) or 
adult children (17.8%). Over 40% had scores indicating risk for clinical 
depression. Post-death caregiver experiences (depression, quality of life, 
grief, resilience) correlated with pre-death caregiver experiences. Post-death 
experiences did not associate with patient characteristics, disease-related 
symptoms, or healthcare services used in the last 6 months of life. Trajectories 
for caregiver measures from pre- to post-death visits varied widely. Interview 
themes included grief and sadness, anger, guilt and regret, relief, 
appreciation/gratitude, and adjusting to a new normal.ConclusionsThe finding 
that pre-death caregiving experiences have the strongest association with 
post-death experiences emphasizes the critical importance of accessible and 
evidence-based caregiver support before and after the death of a person with 
DLB. Research is needed to develop interventions for current and bereaved 
caregivers of individuals with DLB.Trial registration informationNCT04829656

Introduction: Survivors from racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds tend to 
experience cancer-related fatigue (CRF) at higher rates than non-Hispanic Whites 
(NHWs), often leading to a decline in quality of life (QOL). It is crucial to 
consider the impact their marginalized identities have on cancer outcomes. 
Although yoga has shown promise as a supportive intervention for CRF and QOL, 
existing research has largely centered on NHW populations. This study seeks to 
evaluate the impact of yoga on CRF and QOL among racially and ethnically diverse 
survivors and compare outcomes with NHW survivors. Methods: This study used data 
from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs; n = 1,153) examining a 4-week Yoga 
for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS) intervention designed to address insomnia in 
survivors. YOCAS integrates elements of gentle Hatha and Restorative Yoga, 
featuring breathing techniques, mindful movement, and posture alignment, for 150 
min each week for 4 weeks. Survivors were eligible if they (1) were age 21+, (2) 
were randomized to YOCAS©®, (3) identified as Hispanic or a non-Hispanic person 
of color, and (4) provided evaluable data on the Functional Assessment for 
Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue and Functional Assessment for Cancer 
Therapy-General at pre- and postintervention. Results: Forty-nine participants 
were eligible (mean age = 53; 96% female; 79% stage 0-II cancer; 74% breast 
cancer). Participants reported nonclinically meaningful improvements in overall 
CRF improvement (1.55, standard deviation [SD] = 14.67, p < 0.061), total QOL 
(3.04, SD = 0.055, p < 0.055), the emotional component of QOL (0.85, SD = 6.3, p 
< 0.061), and significant improvements in the physical component of QOL (1.32, 
SD = 7.0, p < 0.035). Session attendance averaged six out of eight sessions. 
Participants also engaged in an additional self-guided yoga practice at home 
each week. Most (86%) participants expressed that the program was beneficial in 
managing symptoms and indicated they would suggest it to survivors. Discussion: 
Findings suggest: (1) YOCAS©® has the potential to alleviate fatigue and enhance 
QOL in racially and ethnically diverse survivors; (2) while participation rates 
remain modest, there is openness to yoga; and (3) diverse survivors are capable 
of completing a 4-week yoga program, report it as useful for controlling 
symptoms, and are likely to suggest it to survivors. Future research should 
include well-powered RCTs to verify YOCAS©®'s effects on CRF and QOL in these 
populations.

BACKGROUND: The care of the injured pregnant patient presents unique challenges. 
There is no consensus on how best to approach certain aspects of injury during 
pregnancy. In this review, we aim to clarify the current care of the injured 
pregnant patient by reviewing the existing literature guided by clinical 
experience.
METHODS: Clinically relevant questions regarding the management of pregnant 
trauma patients with defined Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes 
(PICOs) were determined specific to resuscitative hysterotomy (RH), fetal 
monitoring, pregnancy-specific laboratory tests, imaging, and timing of fetal 
evaluation. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were conducted 
using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation 
methodology. Appropriate studies that met the inclusion criteria did not exist 
for PICO1 on RH and PICO5 on timing of fetal evaluation. We therefore relied on 
a literature review and expert consensus to address these PICOs.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies were identified for systematic review, and a subset was 
deemed appropriate for meta-analysis. In trauma patients with pregnancies 
(estimated gestational age, ≥20 weeks) undergoing resuscitative thoracotomy for 
traumatic arrest, we conditionally recommend RH as soon as possible. In trauma 
patients with viable pregnancies, we conditionally recommend a formal 
observation period of at least 4 to 6 hours. In trauma patients with viable 
pregnancies, we cannot recommend for or against pregnancy-specific laboratory 
tests and nonionizing radiation imaging being performed. The workgroup suggests 
that possible effects of ionizing radiation exposure should not prevent 
medically indicated diagnostic imaging. Kleihauer-Betke testing should be 
performed in patients who are Rh negative to determine an appropriate dose of Rh 
D immunoglobulin. In trauma patients with viable pregnancies, we conditionally 
recommend that fetal assessment should be performed at the end of the primary 
survey after a rapid maternal evaluation.
CONCLUSION: This work summarizes the best available evidence pertaining to the 
management of trauma in pregnancy, as the best early treatment of the fetus is 
the optimal resuscitation of the mother.

BACKGROUND: Increasing reliance on digital health resources can create 
disparities among older patients. Understanding health-related, mobility, and 
socioeconomic factors associated with the use of eHealth technologies is 
important for addressing inequitable access to health care.
OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess digital health literacy among patients aged ≥65 
years and identify factors associated with their ability to access, understand, 
and use digital health resources.
METHODS: We developed a survey instrument grounded in the Technology Acceptance 
Model and conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-mode survey of patients aged ≥65 
years from an integrated, multispecialty medical center. Digital health literacy 
was measured using the eHeals health literacy scale, and responses were analyzed 
across self-rated health, self-reported mobility, and socioeconomic deprivation 
assessed with the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). Counts (n) and frequencies (%) 
are reported across response groups, and analyses for differences are performed 
using the χ2 test for independence or the Fisher exact test.
RESULTS: Analyses included 878 responses (response rate=878/2847; 30.8%). There 
was a significant difference in the distribution of race between responders and 
nonresponders (P<.001) but no significant differences were observed by age 
(P=.053) or gender (P=.73). Respondents with lower self-rated health had lower 
levels of digital health literacy; only 54.2% (n=13/25) participants with poor 
self-rated health were able to send a message to their doctor compared to 89.5% 
(n=68/77) of patients with excellent self-rated health. All comparisons across 
the digital health literacy domains revealed significant differences across 
self-rated health groups (P<.05). Respondents with mobility restrictions had 
lower levels of digital health literacy, including lower frequencies of 
reporting knowledge of what health resources are available on the internet 
(mobility restricted, n=92/182; 52.0% vs no mobility restriction, n=433/688; 
64.7%), knowledge of how to find health resources on the internet (mobility 
restricted, n=120/182; 67.4% vs no mobility restriction, n=513/688; 76.8%), and 
ability to use a camera or video with a doctor easily (mobility restricted, 
n=58/182; 32.6% vs no mobility restriction, n=321/688; 48.0%). Older adults 
experiencing increased socioeconomic deprivation, as measured by the ADI, 
reported lower rates of digital health literacy across most categories, 
including knowledge of how to find health resources on the internet (high ADI, 
n=28/49; 59.6% vs low ADI, n=551/751; 75.5%) and the ability to send an 
electronic message to their doctor easily (high ADI, n=27/49; 57.4% vs low ADI, 
n=584/751; 80.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to 
improve engagement with eHealth among patients aged ≥65 years, who are impacted 
by poor health, limited mobility, and socioeconomic deprivation. Enhancing 
digital health literacy can help bridge the gap in access to digital health 
resources and improve overall health outcomes for this population.

BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment for resectable gastric and gastroesophageal 
junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma remains unclear due to limited head-to-head 
comparisons among chemotherapy and chemoradiation regimens. This network 
meta-analysis aimed to determine the relative efficacy of available 
multimodality treatment regimens in these patients.
METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and CENTRAL were searched till 
September 20, 2024. Phase 3 randomized trials evaluating 
perioperative/neoadjuvant systemic therapy ± radiation in resectable gastric/GEJ 
adenocarcinoma were included. Primary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS) 
and overall survival (OS). Frequentist network meta-analysis was conducted to 
compare hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: Fifteen trials (8072 patients) were analyzed. pFLOT (perioperative 
fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and docetaxel) ranked highest for DFS in 
the overall population (P-score 91%), achieving significant improvements 
compared to surgery alone (HR 0.48, 95% CI, 0.38-0.60) and nCROSS (neoadjuvant 
paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiotherapy) (0.67, 0.56-0.81). For OS, 
nPLF + nCRT(EP) (neoadjuvant cisplatin, leucovorin, and fluorouracil for 
induction, followed by etoposide, cisplatin, and radiotherapy) (P-score 90%) and 
pFLOT (P-score 87%) were the top regimens. pFLOT significantly outperformed 
surgery alone (0.57, 0.45-0.72) and nCROSS (0.73, 0.60-0.89). Based on the 
limited data available, adding neoadjuvant chemoradiation to pFLOT provided no 
additional OS (1.14, 0.76-1.72) or DFS (1.22, 0.83-1.82) benefit. Similarly, 
adding pembrolizumab to perioperative chemotherapy (cisplatin and 
fluorouracil/capecitabine) was not superior to pFLOT (DFS: 1.10, 0.71-1.69; OS: 
1.09, 0.69-1.72).
CONCLUSIONS: pFLOT demonstrated superior efficacy in resectable gastric/GEJ 
adenocarcinoma, outperforming surgery alone, nCROSS, and alternative 
perioperative regimens. The additive role of immunotherapy requires further 
investigation to optimize patient selection and outcomes.

OBJECTIVES: To compare whether femoral version more closely mirrors the 
contralateral femur or a population norm estimate of 15° of anteversion.
DESIGN: Radiologic observational study.
SETTING: Level I Trauma Center.
PATIENT SELECTION CRITERIA: Patients with no history of anatomy-altering femoral 
injury who underwent bilateral lower extremity CT scans.Outcome Measures and 
Comparisons: CTs were analyzed to measure femoral version on each side. The 
asymmetry in femoral version between left and right in each patient 
(interfemoral rotational variance [IRV]) was recorded. The difference of each 
femur's version from a proposed population mean of 15° of anteversion was also 
recorded.
RESULTS: 219 patients with a mean femoral version of 14.9° ± 10.5° of 
anteversion were included. Mean IRV was 5.3°, compared to 8.2° of mean variation 
from the population norm of 15° of anteversion (p<0.001). Five percent of 
patients had IRV >15° compared to 15% that had femoral rotation > 15° from the 
population mean of 15° (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of a comminuted diaphyseal femur fracture, knowledge 
of the appropriate target for restoration of rotational alignment is critical. 
This radiologic cohort study found that on average, femoral version more closely 
mirrors an individual patient's contralateral femur as opposed to a population 
norm of 15° of anteversion.

BACKGROUND: Shared decision-making is increasingly utilized when multiple 
reasonable options exist. In the emergency department, however, several 
perceived barriers-such as time constraints, illness complexity, and varying 
levels of acceptance-limit its use. In cases of acute otitis media (AOM) in 
children, parental expectations for immediate antibiotic treatment often 
conflict with national guidelines recommending a trial of analgesics for 48 to 
72 h prior to initiating antibiotics. As a result, antibiotic prescribing rates 
in the emergency department remain high, reaching up to 96%. Our aim was to 
measure the impact of the ear pain decision aid on parental knowledge, 
engagement and antibiotic use.
METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial in the Emergency Department and 
affiliated Urgent Care setting comparing shared decision-making with a web-based 
decision aid (earpaindecisionaid.org) to usual care for parents of children aged 
6 months and older with non-severe AOM. Outcomes included parental knowledge of 
AOM, clinician/parent engagement, interaction time, and antibiotic use.
RESULTS: One hundred-one parents were enrolled; 42 participated in the Ear Pain 
Decision Aid (EPDA) arm using shared decision-making, while 59 received usual 
care (UC). Fifty-one interactions were videotaped. Parents in the EPDA arm 
scored greater in knowledge: EPDA 6.1 (1.74) vs. UC 5.1 (1.79), mean difference 
1.0 (95% CI 0.3, 1.7), p = 0.004. They also scored high in decision-making: EPDA 
14.7 (2.86) vs. UC 8.75 (3.68), mean difference 6.0 (95% CI 1.9, 10.0), 
p = 0.005. There was no significant difference in interaction time: EPDA 4.2 min 
(3.2, 5.6) vs. UC 3.0 min (2.4, 4.4), p = 0.059. No difference was detected in 
immediate antibiotic prescriptions: EPDA 36% vs. UC 42%, odds ratio 0.76 (95% CI 
0.33, 1.71), p = 0.50. Similarly, no significant difference was found in 
wait-and-see prescription use: EPDA 64% vs. UC 6a8%, odds ratio 1.32 (95% CI 
0.59, 2.99), p = 0.50.
CONCLUSION: Shared decision-making with the Ear Pain Decision Aid (EPDA) 
improved parental knowledge and engagement without significantly increasing 
interaction time in the emergency department. Although no significant reduction 
in antibiotic prescribing was observed, this may be due to the study's limited 
sample size, which increases the risk of Type II error. These findings support 
the feasibility of integrating shared decision-making tools into emergency care. 
Larger, multicenter studies are needed to further evaluate the EPDA's 
effectiveness in promoting antibiotic stewardship for pediatric acute otitis 
media.

The optimal treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or 
Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) with preexisting cardiomyopathy is uncertain. An 
anonymous, electronic survey was distributed by e-mail to three US lymphoma 
cooperative groups, two community hospitals, and twelve academic medical 
systems, and distributed at one international lymphoma meeting. Fifty 
hematology-oncology providers caring for patients with lymphoma were included. 
In response to a vignette of a 67-yo with Stage III DLBCL with LVEF of 40-45%, 
15 (30%) would use non-anthracycline regimens, 13 (26%) R-CHOP with liposomal 
doxorubicin instead of doxorubicin, 11 (22%) R-CHOP without modification and 6 
(12%) R-CHOP with a continuous doxorubicin infusion. In a second vignette of a 
patient with HL in remission after frontline treatment with doxorubicin 
cumulative dose 300 mg/m2, 16 (32%) would order an echocardiogram after 
treatment. There was substantial variability in preferred treatment regimens 
with preexisting cardiomyopathy and in cardiac monitoring after anthracycline.

INTRODUCTION: Von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer analysis is essential for 
diagnosing and classifying von Willebrand disease (VWD) but requires expert 
interpretation and is subject to inter-rater variability. We developed an 
automated image analysis pipeline using deep learning to improve the 
reproducibility and efficiency of VWF multimer pattern classification.
METHODS: We trained a YOLOv8 deep learning model on 514 gel images (6168 labeled 
instances) to classify VWF multimer patterns into 12 classes. The model was 
validated on 192 images (2304 instances) and tested on an independent set of 94 
images (1128 instances). Images underwent preprocessing, including histogram 
equalization, contrast enhancement, and gamma correction. Two expert raters 
provided ground truth classifications.
RESULTS: The model achieved 91% accuracy compared to Expert 1 (macro-averaged 
precision = 0.851, recall = 0.757, F1-score = 0.786) and 87% accuracy compared 
to Expert 2 (macro-averaged precision = 0.653, recall = 0.653, 
F1-score = 0.641). Inter-rater agreement was very high between experts 
(κ = 0.883), with strong agreement between the model and Expert 1 (κ = 0.845) 
and good agreement with Expert 2 (κ = 0.773). The model performed exceptionally 
well on common patterns (F1 > 0.93) but showed lower performance on rare 
subtypes.
CONCLUSION: Automated VWF multimer analysis using deep learning demonstrates 
high accuracy in pattern classification and could standardize the interpretation 
of VWF multimer patterns. While not replacing expert analysis, this approach 
could improve the efficiency of expert human review, potentially streamlining 
laboratory workflow and expanding access to VWF multimer testing.

BACKGROUND: Cytoreductive hepatectomy for liver metastases from G3 
neuroendocrine tumors (NETLM) and neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECLM) remains an 
issue of controversy, with guidelines recommending surgery for limited 
metastatic burden from NET G3 and systemic therapy for NEC. We assessed surgical 
and oncologic outcomes after hepatectomy, and factors associated with overall 
survival (OS).
METHODS: Patients undergoing liver resections for G3 NETLM (n = 27) and NECLM 
(n = 15) between January 2000 to December 2020 were compared, stratified for 
median OS and opposed to G1 (n = 75) and G2 NETLM (n = 120).
RESULTS: Median OS after hepatectomy was 12.5 in NETLM G1 patients, 11.2 in G2, 
6.3 in G3 and 2.4 years in NECLM (p < 0.001), with progression-free survival of 
2.1, 1.3, 0.8 and 0.7 years, respectively (p < 0.001). Bilobar lesions (92 % vs. 
29 %; p < 0.001) and numbers (p < 0.001) were higher in NETLM G3 than in NECLM. 
Major resections (22 % vs. 20 %; p = 1.000), severe complications (33 % vs. 
20 %; p = 0.485), and 90-day mortality (7 % vs. 7 %; p = 1.000) were similarly 
frequent. NETLM G3 long-survivors did not reach median OS after 7 years and 4 
years in NECLM. Lesion diameter and count >10 were associated with survival in 
NETLM G3, while no patient or tumor characteristics were linked to OS in NECLM.
CONCLUSION: Although G3 NETLM and NECLM display significantly worse prognosis 
after cytoreductive hepatectomy compared to G1 and G2 NETLM, some patients might 
benefit from surgery. While tumor size and lesion count were linked to OS, 
identification of factors besides standard clinical characteristics are needed 
to stratify patients as surgical candidates.

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signalling has become an attractive 
therapeutic target due to its pro-tumorigenic actions on epithelial cells and 
its immunosuppressive effects in the tumour microenvironment. In intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA), a highly aggressive malignancy of the biliary tract 
with poor prognosis, the latest clinical trials using TGF-β inhibitors have 
failed indicating that the specific actions carried out by TGF-β in iCCA are yet 
not well delineated. Here, we show that TGF-β signalling is highly active in 
iCCA and exerts a prominent suppressor effect on tumour cell lines and organoids 
established from iCCA metastases biopsies, that relies on a functional canonical 
SMAD2/3/4 signalling. Thus, TGF-β inhibitors promote, instead of inhibiting, 
tumour cell growth. In this context, a promising strategy is to target 
intracellular proteins downstream the TGF-β receptors accounting only for TGF-β 
pro-tumorigenic actions. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a downstream mediator of the 
TGF-β signalling pathway, is strictly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts 
(CAF) of iCCA and acts in concert with NOX1 to regulate CAF functions. Use of a 
dual NOX4/NOX1 inhibitor impaired CAF actions and reduced tumour growth in vitro 
and in two different in vivo iCCA experimental models. Collectively, our 
findings reveal an actionable way to specifically target TGF-β pro-tumorigenic 
actions in CAF from iCCA without undesirable side effects on tumour cells, 
suggesting a potentially bright future for dual NOX4/NOX1 inhibitors in the 
clinics, alone or in combination with other therapies.

BACKGROUND: Postpartum haemorrhage is a leading cause of maternal mortality, 
particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. Several pharmacological 
agents, such as oxytocin, ergot alkaloids, prostaglandins, and tranexamic acid, 
have been used prophylactically to prevent postpartum haemorrhage. However, the 
optimal prophylactic regimen and the comparative efficacy of these agents and 
their combinations have not been fully elucidated for individuals undergoing 
caesarean delivery. We aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis to assess 
different agents for postpartum haemorrhage prophylaxis in caesarean deliveries.
METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we conducted a Bayesian 
network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the 
relative effectiveness of different prophylactic agents and their combinations 
for postpartum haemorrhage in caesarean deliveries. We searched MEDLINE, the 
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and Web of Science from 
database inception to Nov 7, 2023, for RCTs that enrolled adult pregnant women 
(ie, older than 18 years) undergoing a caesarean delivery; compared prophylactic 
strategies (monotherapy or combination drug therapy) with placebo or another 
active prophylactic regimen; administered prophylactic strategies of any 
parenteral dosage or regimen systemically before surgical incision or 
immediately after birth for preventing postpartum haemorrhage; and reported our 
prespecified endpoints of interest. Quasi-randomised trials, trials evaluating 
prophylactic strategies exclusively comparing different dosages, routes, or 
regimens of the same prophylactic agent, trials that included vaginal delivery, 
single-arm studies, conference abstracts, studies not published in English, and 
studies with overlapping populations were excluded. Ten authors reviewed study 
reports and supplementary materials and extracted the data. Two authors 
performed these tasks independently for each study. For data reported in 
graphical format, extraction was performed with graph digitising web software. 
The primary outcome was postpartum haemorrhage (ie, blood loss of ≥1000 mL 
following caesarean delivery). We fitted a Bayesian random-effects network 
meta-analysis model to compare multiple regimens simultaneously, with results 
presented as risk ratios (RRs) and their respective 95% credible intervals 
(CrIs). Only strategies reported by two or more studies were included in the 
network. If a prophylactic strategy was reported by only one study, it was 
included if at least 1000 patients were allocated in each study group. We also 
synthesised head-to-head RCTs separately to assess differences between regimens 
with league tables. To assess the hierarchy of treatments based on efficacy, we 
estimated surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) probabilities. This 
review is registered at PROSPERO, CRD42023488236.
FINDINGS: The search strategy yielded 3339 studies. After removing duplicates, 
2241 studies remained, of which a total of 2022 were excluded on the basis of 
title or abstract screening. After full-text review, 167 RCTs (with 44 817 
patients) evaluating monotherapy with or various combinations of oxytocin, 
carbetocin, carboprost, ergot alkaloids, misoprostol, and tranexamic acid were 
included in the final analysis. Across all 167 studies, 12 868 patients received 
oxytocin monotherapy, 5849 patients received tranexamic acid monotherapy, 2964 
patients received carbetocin monotherapy, 1773 patients received misoprostol 
monotherapy, and 100 patients received carboprost monotherapy. The most common 
combination therapy was tranexamic acid plus oxytocin (n=5331) followed by 
misoprostol plus oxytocin (n=2983). Oxytocin plus tranexamic acid (RR 0·44 [95% 
CrI 0·33-0·58]) and carbetocin (0·54 [0·37-0·74]) were the only interventions 
that were more effective than oxytocin alone in reducing postpartum haemorrhage. 
Oxytocin plus tranexamic acid ranked as the most effective intervention for 
postpartum haemorrhage prophylaxis with a SUCRA probability value of 0·85. Most 
prophylactic combinations reduced intraoperative blood transfusions and the need 
for additional uterotonics. Two maternal deaths were reported among 29 412 
patients. No significant heterogeneity was detected for postpartum haemorrhage 
(I2=6%), blood transfusion (I2=0%), and additional uterotonics (I2=7%).
INTERPRETATION: Carbetocin alone and oxytocin plus tranexamic acid were superior 
to oxytocin monotherapy for preventing postpartum haemorrhage in caesarean 
deliveries. Oxytocin plus tranexamic acid ranked as the most effective 
intervention for postpartum haemorrhage prevention. These results are crucial in 
highlighting the comparative efficacy and hierarchy of prophylactic agents for 
postpartum haemorrhage prevention, especially given the widespread availability 
and low cost associated with oxytocin and tranexamic acid.

Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is the most common conduction abnormality 
following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and has been associated 
with adverse clinical outcomes. While multiple predictors of post-TAVR LBBB have 
been proposed, data remain limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis 
aims to identify and summarize predictors of new-onset LBBB post-TAVR. A 
systematic literature search was performed to identify studies that reported 
predictors of new-onset post-TAVR LBBB. Extracted data included patient factors, 
electrocardiographic (ECG) and anatomic parameters, and device-related factors. 
A random-effects model was used to calculate crude risk ratios (RRs), mean 
differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the predictors. Of 450 
articles screened, 17 studies comprising a total of 6357 patients were included. 
Among these, 26.4% developed post-TAVR LBBB. Increased risk was associated with 
diabetes mellitus (RR: 1.22, p < 0.001), use of 29-mm valve (RR: 1.59, 
p < 0.001), and use of Medtronic CoreValve (MCV) (RR: 2.25, p = 0.008). 
Significant differences were found between patients with and without LBBB in 
interventricular septal thickness (IVS; by -0.66 mm), membranous septal length 
(MSL; by -0.9 mm), left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) diameter (by -0.48 mm), 
PR interval (by +13.95 ms), and prosthesis implantation depth (by +2.6 mm). 
Diabetes Mellitus, use of 29-mm valve or MCV, decreased IVS thickness, shorter 
MSL, smaller LVOT diameter, increased prosthesis implantation depth, and 
prolonged PR duration were all associated with an elevated risk of post-TAVR 
LBBB. Early identification of these predictors may help reduce the risk of 
conduction abnormalities after TAVR.

The antiapoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) promotes cell survival 
in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and its overexpression is associated with 
resistance to venetoclax. Voruciclib, an oral cyclin-dependent kinase 9 
inhibitor, indirectly decreases Mcl-1 protein expression and has synergistic 
activity with venetoclax in AML preclinical models. We hypothesized that 
voruciclib in combination with venetoclax would induce responses in patients 
with AML with disease progression after venetoclax therapy. This dose-escalation 
study evaluated voruciclib administered on days 1 to 14 of 28-day cycles with 
venetoclax daily. The study enrolled 41 adult patients with AML after failure of 
previous standard therapies. Patients had a median of 2 (range, 1-7) previous 
lines of therapy, 19 patients (46%) had ≥3 previous lines of therapy, and 39 
(95%) had previous venetoclax. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported in 7 
dose levels evaluated. The most common adverse events were nausea (34%), febrile 
neutropenia (32%), diarrhea (22%), dyspnea (22%), hypokalemia (22%), and 
thrombocytopenia (22%). Antileukemic activity was observed in 10 (24%) patients, 
including 3 with complete marrow remission and 7 with stable disease lasting ≥3 
months. We observed a rebound of circulating blasts during the 14 days of 
single-agent venetoclax dosing in 40% of evaluable patients. Mcl-1 protein 
expression and RNA polymerase II Ser-2 phosphorylation decreased on voruciclib. 
Overall, the combination of voruciclib with venetoclax was tolerable in patients 
with relapsed/refractory AML, had antileukemic activity, and showed on-target 
effects in heavily pretreated patients with disease progression after 
venetoclax. This trial was registered at www.ClinicalTrials.gov as #NCT03547115.

INTRODUCTION: Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and concomitant 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of colorectal cancer 
(CRC). However, the risk of CRC in patients with PSC without IBD remains 
uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the risk of CRC in patients with PSC without a 
history of IBD using a large national database.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX database to 
identify patients ≥ 18 years with PSC. Patients were then divided into two 
groups, PSC with IBD (PSC-IBD cohort) and PSC without IBD (PSC non-IBD cohort), 
and were matched with patients without a history of PSC or IBD (non-PSC/non-IBD 
group) by using 1:1 propensity score matching. The primary outcome was the risk 
of first diagnosis of CRC. With censoring applied, Kaplan-Meier analysis with 
hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs was used to compare time-to-event rates at daily 
time intervals.
RESULTS: PSC patients without IBD were at increased risk of CRC compared to the 
non-PSC/IBD cohort (aHR = 2.91; 95% CI: 1.6-6.0). Patients with PSC and IBD 
exhibited a higher risk of CRC (aHR = 6.5; 95% CI: 3.78-11.2), especially among 
the UC cohort (aHR = 6.3; 95% CI: 3.2-12.4). Patients with PSC were at increased 
risk of various gastrointestinal malignancies (aHR = 10.5; 95% CI: 7.3-15; 
p < 0.0001), including hepatobiliary cancers, pancreatic cancer, and 
hepatocellular carcinoma.
DISCUSSION: Our findings provide real-world evidence that PSC is an independent 
risk factor for colorectal cancer, even in the absence of concomitant IBD. These 
results support the need for further research to determine whether patients with 
isolated PSC may benefit from tailored CRC surveillance strategies.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Bile acid sequestrants (BAS) are an emerging option for 
treatment of pouchitis. We aimed to compare BAS monotherapy, antibiotics, and 
combination therapy with both in the treatment of pouchitis after ileal 
pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC).
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the US-Collaborative 
TriNetX database to identify patients with acute pouchitis and UC. Treatment 
groups were divided into BAS (cholestyramine, colesevelam, colestipol), 
antibiotics (ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole), and combination therapy of 
both BAS and antibiotics. Primary outcomes were failure of initial therapy 
(early relapse or nonresponse) and the development of recurrent pouchitis in the 
first 12 months after an initial episode of pouchitis.
RESULTS: Our analysis included 1,136 patients (mean age: 37.8 ± 15.4 years, and 
45.9% female) of whom 727 (64%) were diagnosed with recurrent pouchitis. After 
adjusting for confounders by propensity-score matching, there was no significant 
difference in the odds of early relapse or nonresponse with BAS compared with 
antibiotic monotherapy (aOR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.40-1.38; p = 0.34) or combination 
therapy (aOR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.47-1.88; p = 0.86). Patients treated with BAS had 
a statistically significant lower recurrent pouchitis rate (aHR: 0.57; 95% CI: 
0.42-0.79; p < 0.001) compared with patients treated with antibiotics. Patients 
treated with BAS had a statistically significant longer time (median: 225 days) 
to recurrent pouchitis (p < 0.001) compared to antibiotics (median: 99 days).
CONCLUSION: Using real-world evidence regarding treatment of pouchitis compared 
to standard antibiotic therapy, BAS monotherapy was not inferior for initial 
treatment response and significantly prolonged time to recurrent pouchitis.

BACKGROUND: Major surgeries often lead to significant insensible fluid losses, 
posing challenges in achieving optimal fluid balance. Estimated plasma volume 
status (ePVS), calculated using the Kaplan-Hakim formula from hemoglobin and 
hematocrit values, serves as a marker for volume status and has been associated 
with adverse outcomes in various medical conditions. This study aims to explore 
the correlation of preoperative ePVS with postoperative outcomes in patients 
undergoing open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 329 patients who underwent 
open AAA repair between 2018 and 2023, requiring intensive care unit admission 
for more than 24 hours. Data were included demographic information, comorbid 
conditions, preoperative laboratory values, intraoperative data, and 
postoperative outcomes. ePVS was calculated preoperatively and its association 
with postoperative outcomes was analyzed using statistical tests including 
student's t-test, chi-square test.
RESULTS: Patients with preoperative ePVS at or above the median (-11.5) had 
significantly higher rates of postoperative vasopressor support (P = .003), 
thrombotic events (P = .008), reintubation (P = .004), and sepsis (P = .044). 
ePVS at or above the median was also associated with longer surgery duration (P 
= .011). Multivariable logistic regression identified ePVS as an independent 
predictor of major postoperative complications (odds ratio [OR], 1.047; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 1.019-1.078; P = .001) and 30-day operative mortality 
(OR, 1.042; 95% CI, 1.000-1.083; P = .038).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative ePVS can be a predictor of postoperative outcomes in 
patients undergoing open AAA repair. Higher preoperative ePVS is associated with 
increased risk of complications and 30-day mortality.

BACKGROUND: Fecal microbiota, live-jslm (RBL; REBYOTA®), is the first 
single-dose, broad consortia, microbiota-based live biotherapeutic approved by 
the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent recurrent Clostridioides 
difficile infection (rCDI) in adults following standard-of-care antimicrobials. 
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a common risk factor for rCDI, yet patients 
with IBD are often excluded from prospective trials. This subgroup analysis of 
PUNCH CD3-OLS (NCT03931941) evaluated the safety and efficacy of RBL in 
participants with rCDI and IBD.
METHODS: Participants with IBD (ulcerative colitis [UC], Crohn's disease [CD], 
or unspecified) who had rCDI were included. Treatment-emergent adverse event 
(TEAE) data were collected for up to 6 months following RBL administration. 
Efficacy outcomes included treatment success at 8 weeks and sustained clinical 
response at 6 months.
RESULTS: Overall, 793 participants were enrolled, and 697 received RBL; 74 had 
IBD (UC: n = 45; CD: n = 25; unspecified IBD: n = 4). TEAEs within 8 weeks of 
administration were reported by 45.9% and 47.5% of participants with and without 
IBD, respectively; most were mild or moderate gastrointestinal symptoms. Serious 
TEAEs within 8 weeks of administration were reported by 1.4% and 4.2% of 
participants with and without IBD, respectively. The treatment success rate at 8 
weeks was 78.9%, and the sustained clinical response rate at 6 months was 91.1% 
in participants with IBD, similar to rates in participants without IBD (73.2% 
and 91.0%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this subgroup analysis of PUNCH CD3-OLS suggest RBL 
is safe and efficacious in patients with IBD.

Plain Language Summary: This post hoc subgroup analysis of PUNCH CD3-OLS reports 
that fecal microbiota, live-jslm (RBL), was well-tolerated and efficacious for 
preventing recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection in individuals with 
inflammatory bowel disease, supporting the use of RBL in this high-risk patient 
population.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of extent of parotidectomy on surgical and 
oncologic outcomes in low grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (LGMEC).
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all patients undergoing primary 
surgical treatment for LGMEC from 2000 to 2022 was conducted. Clinical features 
collected included demographics, facial nerve function, operative techniques, 
postoperative complications/facial nerve function, and recurrence.
RESULTS: 58 patients were included; 10 patients underwent partial parotidectomy 
(PP), 38 underwent superficial parotidectomy (SP), and 10 underwent 
near-total/total parotidectomy. PP and SP patients had smaller tumors and more 
superficial tumors compared to near-total/total parotidectomy group (P = .03). 
PP and SP were more likely to have negative margins and less locoregional 
disease compared to near-total/total parotidectomy patients (P < .01). 
Near-total/total parotidectomy were more likely to undergo facial nerve 
resection (20% vs 0% for PP & SP respectively) (P = .05). Immediate 
postoperative facial nerve function was significantly better among PP patients 
(73% HB I) compared to SP (44% HB I) and near-total/total parotidectomy patients 
(0% HB I) (P < .01). Most patients regained their facial nerve function although 
only 40% of the near-total/total parotidectomy patients had a HB I at the time 
of last follow up (P < .01). Patients were followed for a median of 6.2 years, 
during which only 1 patient (total parotidectomy) had a recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: PP offers a safe and effective approach for small LGMEC tumors, 
ensuring better facial nerve function postoperatively with minimal complications 
compared to more extensive surgery.

Atypical frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin-positive inclusions 
(aFTLD-U) is a rare cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), 
characterized postmortem by neuronal inclusions of the FET family of proteins 
(FTLD-FET). The recent discovery of TAF15 amyloid filaments in aFTLD-U brains 
represents a significant step toward improved diagnostic and therapeutic 
strategies. However, our understanding of the etiology of this FTLD subtype 
remains limited, which severely hampers translational research efforts. To 
explore the transcriptomic changes in aFTLD-U, we performed bulk RNA sequencing 
on the frontal cortex tissue of 21 aFTLD-U patients and 20 control individuals. 
Cell-type deconvolution revealed loss of excitatory neurons and a higher 
proportion of astrocytes in aFTLD-U relative to controls. Differential gene 
expression and co-expression network analysis, adjusted for the shift in 
cell-type proportions, showed dysregulation of mitochondrial pathways, 
transcriptional regulators, and upregulation of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) 
pathway, including the GLI1 transcription factor, in aFTLD-U. Overall, 
oligodendrocyte and astrocyte-enriched genes were significantly over-represented 
among the differentially expressed genes. Differential splicing analysis 
confirmed the dysregulation of non-neuronal cell types with significant splicing 
alterations, particularly in oligodendrocyte-enriched genes, including myelin 
basic protein (MBP), a crucial component of myelin. Immunohistochemistry in 
frontal cortex brain tissue also showed reduced myelin levels in aFTLD-U 
patients compared to controls. Together, these findings highlight a central role 
for glial cells, particularly astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, in the 
pathogenesis of aFTLD-U, with disruptions in mitochondrial activity, RNA 
metabolism, Shh signaling, and myelination as possible disease mechanisms. This 
study offers the first transcriptomic insight into aFTLD-U and presents new 
avenues for research into FTLD-FET.

University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.

OBJECTIVES: Children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often have low body 
mass index (BMI). BMI does not distinguish between fat and lean mass. Body 
composition deficits may be associated with worse clinical outcomes. We examined 
the prevalence of risk factors associated with body composition deficits in 
youth with pediatric-onset IBD, and factors associated with low lean mass in the 
presence of a normal BMI Z-score (BMI-Z).
METHODS: Newly diagnosed IBD patients ages 5-20 years with whole body dual 
energy x-ray absorptiometry scans acquired between 2014 and 2019 were included. 
Appendicular lean soft tissue mass index (AppLSTMI) and fat mass index (FMI) 
were expressed as age and sex-specific Z-scores. Clinical and demographic data 
were collected retrospectively. Logistic regression was used to assess 
associations with body composition outcomes.
RESULTS: Five hundred sixteen patients were included, 26% had AppLSTMI Z-score 
(AppLSTMI-Z) < -2, 4% had BMI-Z < -2, and none had FMI Z-score (FMI-Z) < -2. 
Increased risk of low AppLSTMI-Z associated with Crohn's diagnosis, Asian 
ethnicity, disease activity, elevated platelets, and glucocorticoid use. Females 
had lower FMI-Z. Low AppLSTMI-Z within the context of BMI-Z (n = 112) was 
associated with Crohn's disease, Asian (odds ratio [OR] = 3.77, p = 0.001) and 
Black identity (OR = 0.32, p = 0.02), and elevated platelets (OR = 1.76, 
p = 0.02) compared to those with normal BMI-Z and normal AppLSTMI-Z.
CONCLUSIONS: BMI is a poor indicator of body composition in children with IBD as 
it masks lean mass deficits which are highly prevalent. Future studies regarding 
the long-term consequences and reversibility of this deficit are warranted.

The accurate interpretation of scalp EEG remains an instrumental diagnostic 
component of epilepsy care. Knowledge of what constitutes normal EEG findings, 
non-epileptiform abnormalities, and epileptiform patterns-both ictal and 
interictal-is essential for appropriate patient management. The International 
League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) has developed an educational curriculum 
containing learning objectives necessary to accurately diagnose and manage 
people with epilepsy. In this Seminar in Epileptology, we address the learning 
objectives related to assessment and interpretation of EEG background activity, 
normal sleep patterns, provocation methods, interictal abnormalities, and ictal 
patterns, as well as a brief discussion on relevant advances in scalp EEG 
analysis and future perspectives on this topic.

BACKGROUND & AIM: The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a highly variable, 
pouch-like structure in the left atrium prone to thrombus formation, especially 
in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. In silico cardiac models can help 
characterize the LAA's complex morphology and hemodynamics, aiding in 
identifying pro-thrombotic areas. This study assessed atrial hemodynamics and 
thrombus formation risk after LAA excision and compared with optimal synthetic 
excisions and occluder placements in high thrombogenic-risk cases.
METHODS: We included 33 patients from the MARK-AF study who had persistent AF 
and underwent excision of the LAA. We quantified the morphological 
characteristics of the post-excision LAA remnant. With patient-specific atrial 
geometries and boundary conditions, in silico blood flow simulations were 
performed. For each patient, we quantified multiple in silico indices to 
characterize blood flow patterns and identify thrombogenic regions. We performed 
an in silico comparison of different LAA treatment approaches.
RESULTS: In our cohort, 25/33 (76 %) of patients had a post-excision, protruding 
LAA remnant (LAA depth >10 mm). In silico simulations indicated that patients 
with a protruding remnant more frequently showed unfavorable values for in 
silico indices associated with high thrombogenic risk at the excision site. 
However, a prominent LAA remnant was not the only factor associated with a high 
thrombogenic risk. An optimal excision or optimal occluder device placement 
reduced thrombus formation risk.
CONCLUSION: The combination of LAA remnant morphology and hemodynamics 
contributed to thrombus formation risk. Advanced in silico simulations uniquely 
enabled the comparison of different therapies, until now only centered on device 
occluders, contributing to digital twins in AF.

BACKGROUND: Secukinumab, a fully human, monoclonal antibody targeting 
interleukin-17A, is approved for moderate-to-severe HS in adults. This study 
evaluated pharmacokinetics (PK), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) 
changes, and safety of secukinumab over 52 weeks in SUNSHINE and SUNRISE Phase 3 
trials.
METHODS: An exploratory analysis of pooled Phase-3 trials evaluated serum PK and 
safety of secukinumab 300 mg every 2 (SECQ2W) or 4 weeks (SECQ4W). A population 
PK model assessed the effects of body weight, disease severity, and baseline 
hsCRP on secukinumab serum concentration. Exposure-response analysis assessed 
the relationship between predicted PK and HS clinical response [HiSCR]. No 
confirmatory statistical testing was performed.
RESULTS: Mean serum trough concentration at Weeks 16, 24, and 52 was ~2-fold 
higher with SECQ2W vs. SECQ4W. At Week 16, exposure overlap was high, with an 
estimated numerical increase in HiSCR of ~3% for SECQ2W over SECQ4W. At Week 52, 
HiSCR levels plateaued. At Week 16, hsCRP decreased from 18.6 ± 26.3 mg/L to 
12.8 ± 18.0 mg/L (SECQ2W), 15.9 ± 27.6 mg/L to 11.5 ± 18.4 mg/L (SECQ4W), and 
remained unchanged with placebo (14.4 ± 22.5 mg/L to 14.7 ± 23.8 mg/L); 
reductions were sustained through Week 52. Higher body weight, disease severity, 
and baseline hsCRP were associated with lower secukinumab serum concentrations. 
Secukinumab immunogenicity was low (< 1%), with no new safety signals.
CONCLUSION: Secukinumab serum concentrations in patients with HS varied with 
body weight, disease severity, and baseline hsCRP. SECQ2W may benefit certain 
patients. Secukinumab reduced hsCRP through Week 52. The safety profile of 
secukinumab was consistent with other approved indications, with no apparent 
dose-response relationship observed.

OBJECTIVES: Chest tubes have traditionally been inserted after thoracotomy to 
evacuate air and fluid, thereby preventing inadequate lung expansion or tension 
pneumothorax. However, this practice has recently been questioned. This study 
was aimed at assessing the safety of omitting chest tube insertion in pediatric 
patients undergoing thoracotomy.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study among all pediatric patients younger 
than 19 years who underwent thoracotomy between January 2016 and October 2018 at 
our center. Data including patient demographics and surgical outcomes were 
collected and compared between all patients with vs without intraoperative chest 
tube insertion.
RESULTS: Among 66 identified patients, 38 (57.6 %) had a chest tube inserted (CT 
group), and 28 (42.4 %) had no chest tube inserted (NCT group) intraoperatively. 
The median patient age was 13 years (range 1-19 years). A total of 59 patients 
(89.4 %) underwent lung wedge resection, 4 (6.1 %) underwent rib excision, and 3 
(4.5 %) underwent thoracotomy for mediastinal mass excision. Among the patients 
who underwent lung wedge resection, fewer than three lesions were resected from 
the lung in 24 patients (96.0 %) in the NCT group and 25 patients (73.5 %) in 
the CT group, representing a statistically significant difference (P = 
0.034).The median hospital stay in the CT group (5 (range 2, 15) days) was 
significantly longer than that in the NCT group (2.50 (range 1, 8) days) (P ≥ 
0.0001). Follow-up imaging indicated full lung expansion in 34 patients (89.5 %) 
in the CT group and 23 patients (82.1 %) in the NCT group (no significant 
difference; p = 0.47). No mortalities or readmissions were reported.
CONCLUSION: In pediatric thoracotomy, especially with fewer than three lung 
wedge resections, chest tube insertion can be safely omitted. This approach does 
not increase the postoperative chest tube insertion rate and is associated with 
shorter hospital stays.

Publisher: أهداف البحث: تُدرج أنابيب الصدر تقليديًا بعد جراحة فتح الصدر لإزالة 
الهواء والسوائل، وذلك لمنع ضعف تمدد الرئة أو حدوث استرواح الصدر الضاغط. ومع ذلك، 
فقد تم مؤخرًا التشكيك في هذه الممارسة. تهدف هذه الدراسة إلى تقييم مدى أمان 
الاستغناء عن إدخال أنبوب الصدر لدى المرضى الأطفال الذين يخضعون لعملية فتح الصدر.
طرق البحث: أُجريت دراسة استعادية لجميع المرضى الأطفال دون سن 19 عامًا الذين 
خضعوا لجراحة فتح الصدر في مركز الحسين للسرطان في الأردن بين يناير 2016 وأكتوبر 
2018. شملت البيانات التي جُمعت الخصائص الديموغرافية للمرضى ونتائج العمليات 
الجراحية، وتمت مقارنة النتائج بين المرضى الذين تم إدخال أنبوب صدر لهم أثناء 
الجراحة وأولئك الذين لم يتم إدخاله لهم.
النتائج: تم تضمين 66 مريضًا في الدراسة، حيث تم إدخال أنبوب صدر لـ 38 مريضًا 
(57.6%)، بينما لم يُدخل لـ 28 مريضًا (42.4%). كان متوسط عمر المرضى 13 عامًا 
(المدى: 1–19 سنة). خضع 59 مريضًا (89.4%) لاستئصال إسفيني للرئة، و4 مرضى (6.1%) 
لاستئصال ضلع، و3 مرضى (4.5%) لجراحة استئصال كتلة من المنصف. أظهرت النتائج أن 
معظم المرضى الذين لم يتم إدخال أنبوب صدر لهم خضعوا لاستئصال أقل من ثلاث آفات 
رئوية، مقارنة بمجموعة أنبوب الصدر، وكان الفرق ذا دلالة إحصائية (P=0.034). كان 
متوسط مدة البقاء في المستشفى لمجموعة أنبوب الصدر 5 أيام، مقارنة بـ 2.5 يومًا في 
المجموعة الأخرى (P<0.0001). أظهرت المتابعة التصويرية تمددًا كاملًا للرئة لدى 
89.5% في مجموعة أنبوب الصدر و82.1% في المجموعة الأخرى، دون فرق ذي دلالة إحصائية 
(P=0.47). لم تُسجل أي حالات وفاة أو إعادة تنويم.
الاستنتاجات: في المرضى الأطفال الذين يخضعون لجراحة فتح الصدر، وخصوصًا أولئك 
الذين يتم استئصال ثلاث آفات رئوية أو أقل لديهم، يمكن الاستغناء عن إدخال أنبوب 
الصدر بأمان. لم ترتبط هذه المقاربة بزيادة في الحاجة إلى إدخال أنبوب صدر بعد 
العملية، وارتبطت بفترة إقامة أقصر في المستشفى.

BACKGROUND: Graft thrombosis is a preventable cause of early allograft loss 
after pediatric kidney transplant, but the role of primary thromboprophylaxis is 
uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness and safety of 
thromboprophylaxis in preventing graft thrombosis among children (0-21 years) 
undergoing kidney transplant.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of MEDLINE, Embase, and 
Cochrane Libraries from inception until September 2024. The primary outcome 
assessed by meta-analysis was graft thrombosis, and the secondary outcome was 
major bleeding (per International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 
criteria).
RESULTS: Twenty-five observational studies (21 retrospective and 4 prospective) 
describing 2094 patients (1659 cases and 435 controls) met eligibility criteria. 
Thromboprophylaxis was used universally (ie, all kidney recipients in the study) 
in 64% (1055/1659) or only in high-risk patients (eg, recipient weight <20 kg 
and age <5 years) in 36% (604/1659). Compared with no preventive measures for 
thrombosis, thromboprophylaxis was associated with reduced risk of graft 
thrombosis (odds ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.18-0.53). Subgroup analyses of 
heparinoid-only, universal thromboprophylaxis, and high risk only protocols 
revealed similar findings. Thromboprophylaxis was not associated with increased 
risk of bleeding resulting in surgical exploration or graft loss. The overall 
risk of bias was moderate. Studies showed high clinical and methodologic 
heterogeneity in study populations and thromboprophylaxis protocols.
CONCLUSION: Primary thromboprophylaxis appears effective in preventing kidney 
graft loss from vascular thrombosis in pediatric recipients. This benefit may be 
offset by the risk of bleeding, although clarity on bleeding risk factors is 
lacking. We identified knowledge gaps, including uncertainty about optimal 
thromboprophylaxis regimens and treatment duration.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a nonatherosclerotic cause of 
acute coronary syndrome that primarily affects young women. Although 
intravascular imaging, particularly optical coherence tomography (OCT), provides 
high-resolution visualization of intramural hematoma and dissection planes, its 
routine use in SCAD is not recommended. This is mainly due to the risk of false 
lumen propagation from high-pressure injection of a flushing medium, typically 
viscous contrast medium, to exclude intraluminal blood and enable OCT luminal 
visualization. We present a case series of 3 patients with SCAD who underwent 
flush-free OCT image acquisition, allowing for the identification of intramural 
hematoma without the need for high-pressure contrast injection. In all cases, 
findings were confirmed through conventional contrast OCT image acquisition. Our 
novel approach minimizes procedural risks associated with high-pressure contrast 
injection while preserving the diagnostic benefits of OCT. These findings 
suggest that the flush-free OCT technique is feasible and can be a safer initial 
intravascular modality in patients with suspected SCAD.

Interruptive alerts can negatively impact clinical workflows and contribute to 
alert fatigue, provider frustration, and burnout. Given that interruptive alert 
overriding is a heterogeneous and recurring phenomenon, occurring across 
different organizational contexts with varying characteristics and 
circumstances, we hypothesize a pragmatic approach with multimodal interventions 
to address malfunctioning alert populations and maintain those contributing to 
better patient care.This study aimed to develop a systematic approach to screen, 
identify, and correct malfunctioning interruptive alerts within a tertiary 
healthcare system.We performed screening by assessing the alert population, 
exploring available resources, and defining alert population inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. We identified interruptive alerts and then conducted an 
exploratory analysis. We shared insights from discussions with our expert panel 
to validate our findings and find gaps in current alert monitoring. We then 
performed focus groups and interviews as part of a root cause analysis. To 
address the findings of these investigations, we prioritized which alerts to 
improve, evaluated solutions, and recommended steps to improve our governance 
structure.We developed an approach to assess around 1,500 unique alerts in a 
tertiary center from January to June 2023. We introduced two approaches to 
visually analyze alert populations: alert-focused analysis and people- and 
systems-focused analysis. We utilized an expert panel to further enhance the 
power and speed of alert evaluation and then investigated one emerging alert 
with focus groups, identifying root causes for its malfunction. This alert 
demonstrated how enterprise practice changes, coupled with design and cultural 
issues, can trigger significant alert malfunctions.A multi-modal intervention 
approach is needed to evaluate interruptive alerts and act quickly on findings. 
Utilizing both analytical and nonanalytical methods can work in synergy to 
facilitate this framework. Such approaches may reduce time and be valuable tools 
for optimally allocating resources to tackle institutional alert challenges.

CONTEXT: Women with preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) are at increased risk of 
pregnancy-related complications.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the available supporting evidence for the Endocrine 
Society guidelines about management of PDM in pregnancy.
DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and other sources through February 2025.
STUDY SELECTION: Studies were selected by pairs of independent reviewers.
DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted by pairs of independent reviewers.
DATA SYNTHESIS: We included 17 studies. Meta-analysis showed no significant 
difference between hybrid closed-loop insulin pump (HCL) and standard of care 
regarding time in range (TIR), time above range (TAR), and time below range 
(TBR). HCL had better overnight TIR and TBR. For women with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus (T2DM), intermittent use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was not 
associated with a significant change in the risk of large for gestational age 
(LGA) neonates (2 randomized controlled trials [RCTs], 102 patients). Adding 
metformin to insulin was associated with a lower risk of LGA (2 RCTs, 1126 
patients). Three retrospective studies (1724 patients) suggested increased 
neonatal complications when delivery was induced before 39 weeks of gestation 
(particularly before 38 weeks) in women with preexisting type 1 (T1DM) and T2DM, 
although this evidence was subject to likely confounding. One retrospective 
study showed no increase in neonatal complications with periconceptional 
exposure to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. We could not identify 
comparative studies assessing a screening question about the possibility of 
pregnancy or a carbohydrate restrictive diet.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review addresses various aspects of managing PDM in 
pregnancy and will support the development of the Endocrine Society guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depression are major global health concerns that can 
manifest as primary disorders or as comorbid symptoms alongside other medical 
conditions. Due to the troubling side effects and treatment resistance 
associated with conventional pharmacological interventions, therapeutic agents 
that target oxidative stress and inflammation, such as CoQ10, have been 
considered.
OBJECTIVE: To quantitatively evaluate the effect of CoQ10 on symptoms of 
depression and anxiety across different clinical populations.
METHODS: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-Analyses guidelines and comprehensively searched relevant databases up to 
March 2025. The primary outcomes were depression and anxiety symptoms measured 
by different validated scales. We estimated pooled effect estimates using 
standardized mean differences (SMDs) and applying random-effects models.
RESULTS: We identified seven small trials with up to 400 patients meeting the 
eligibility criteria, of which six studies were included in the meta-analysis. 
CoQ10 demonstrated significant improvement in depression severity compared to 
placebo in trials using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 
6-8 weeks after treatment initiation (3 trials, 158 patients, std. mean 
difference [95% CI] -0.97 [-1.49, -0.45]), and at low daily doses (3 trials, 193 
patients, -0.84 [-1.54, -0.14]). No significant effects were observed in trials 
using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (3 trials, 146 patients, -0.12 [-0.68, 
0.43]). Regarding anxiety severity, only two small studies were analyzed, and no 
statistically significant reduction was observed with CoQ10 (101 patients, -0.28 
[-0.70, 0.13]).
CONCLUSION: Our analysis provided limited evidence that CoQ10 may improve 
depressive symptoms when administered in low doses (100-200 mg/day) and for 
short durations (6-8 weeks). More data is needed for a reliable assessment of 
the effects of Coenzyme Q10 on both depression and anxiety.

Changes in the clinical symptoms of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) are 
currently used to assess responses to treatment. The MAGIC consortium has 
recently shown that the integration of serum biomarkers with clinical symptoms 
at the onset of treatment in a MAGIC Composite Score (MCS) more accurately 
predicts response to treatment and 6-month non-relapse mortality (NRM) than 
clinical symptoms alone. In this study we evaluated whether the integration of 
serum biomarkers and clinical symptoms on day 28 (D28) would also better predict 
NRM than clinical response only (CRO). We analyzed data from 1135 patients 
receiving systemic treatment for acute GVHD and created a fourth MCS category 
for patients with complete resolution of symptoms and low risk clinical 
biomarkers on D28. Using a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model with 
6-month NRM as the endpoint we identified status of MCS 0 or MCS 1 at D28 as 
responses, which we termed the MAGIC Composite Response (MCR). In the validation 
cohort (n=309), MCR more accurately predicted 6-month NRM than CRO (AUC: 0.77 
vs. 0.69; P=0.014) and demonstrated higher negative and positive predictive 
values. MCR correctly reclassified both clinical non-responders and responders: 
28/213 (13%) of clinical responders became non-responders with five-fold higher 
NRM (34.3% vs. 6.8%, P<0.001) and a larger group (29/96, 30%) of clinical 
non-responders became responders with six-fold lower NRM (7.6% vs. 50.7%, 
P<0.001). These findings support the use of MCR as a superior surrogate endpoint 
for long-term GVHD control and survival in future clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: In total hip arthroplasty (THA), proper management of surgical 
incisions is essential for optimal wound healing and patient outcomes. Despite 
advances in surgical techniques, significant challenges remain in preventing 
complications and infections. This study aimed to identify evidence gaps in THA 
wound care, including presurgical preparation, intraoperative practices, and 
postsurgical complications.
METHODS: Using a modified Delphi method, 20 expert orthopedic surgeons from 
Europe and North America participated in a 3-phase consensus process from April 
1 to September 30, 2023. This included a preliminary questionnaire, a remote 
conference, and a final online survey. The panel reviewed literature and 
achieved agreement on 18 consensus statements regarding wound care in THA. A 
secondary aim was to identify critical gaps in current wound care knowledge.
RESULTS: Consensus was reached on 18 statements. Key gaps were identified in the 
effectiveness of mesh-adhesive dressings, optimal closure methods (skin 
adhesives, staples, sutures), cost benefit of barbed sutures, and appropriate 
use of negative pressure wound therapy. These findings highlight the need for 
further research to validate best practices and guide standardized 
evidence-based protocols.
CONCLUSIONS: Addressing these evidence gaps is essential to improve THA wound 
care methods. Future studies should compare closure techniques and new 
technologies to develop more efficient patient-centered strategies. Bridging 
these gaps may reduce complications, enhance outcomes, and lower the burden of 
wound-related issues in THA.

OBJECTIVE: The management of advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) has shifted, with 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) 
surpassing primary debulking surgery (PDS) worldwide. This transition raises 
expectations for reduced need for high-complexity surgery at IDS. Our goal was 
to objectively evaluate surgical complexity required at IDS.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with stage IIIC-IVB 
AOC undergoing IDS or PDS between 2016 and 2021 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, and 
the European Institute of Oncology, Milan. Surgical procedures were classified 
by anatomical location and deemed advanced if not routinely performed by 
gynecologic oncologists during standard staging procedures. Chi-squared tests 
were used to compare rates of advanced procedures between IDS and PDS.
RESULTS: Of 1170 patients, 612 underwent NACT-IDS and 558 PDS. Advanced surgical 
procedures were performed in 51.5 % of IDS and 83 % of PDS cases. Upper 
abdominal procedures were necessary in 41.2 % of IDS and 71.1 % of PDS cases. 
Surgical complexity score was intermediate-to-high in 56.7 % of IDS and 88.45 % 
in PDS cases. CA-125 normalization post-NACT was not a specific predictor of low 
complexity surgery. Complete gross resection (CGR) was achieved in 61.6 % and 
70.3 % of IDS and PDS cases, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Over half of IDS cases after NACT require advanced surgical 
procedures, including upper abdominal surgery. Given the prognostic significance 
of achieving CGR at IDS, efforts to maintain and expand specialized expertise is 
necessary, including advanced surgical training for gynecologic oncologists. 
Reliable predictors of complexity are urged for tailored surgical planning.

Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy is a genetically engineered 
cellular therapy that is currently integrated into the management of hematologic 
malignancies. Institutions treating patients with CAR-T therapy need to 
establish a framework of delivery that covers all the main components of the 
patient journey including intake of patients into the program from referring 
centers, patient selection according to established eligibility criteria, 
apheresis, logistics, bridging therapy, infusion, and postinfusion care. A CAR-T 
therapy program, with its unique requirements, needs to be delivered by a 
multidisciplinary team. Prior to the establishment of the program, a 
well-structured business plan should be developed with a clear financial and/or 
reimbursement model. Consideration should be given to overall capacity and 
staffing requirements. Standard operating procedures and guidelines are vital 
for ensuring that quality standards are clearly defined and adhered to. 
Institutions should develop a research plan for CAR-T therapy that may 
incorporate not only industry-sponsored trials, but also in-house manufacturing 
of investigational CAR-T products. This report presents recommendations from a 
group of international experts, highlighting the priorities and considerations 
when developing a new CAR-T program.

INTRODUCTION: Pyruvate kinase (PK) is an important glycolytic enzyme responsible 
for erythrocytic ATP production. PK allosteric activators have been shown to 
increase ATP and reduce 2,3-disphosphoglycerate among red blood cells leading to 
improved oxygen affinity, sickling, and hemolysis. In this systematic review, we 
aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PK activators in hemolytic anemias.
METHODS: This study was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. A literature 
search was conducted using relevant keywords over PubMed/Medline, Google 
Scholar, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrial.gov, till 29 September 2024. 
Relevant data was extracted into a spreadsheet and synthesized qualitatively.
RESULTS: The literature search yielded 7,153 results, with seven studies 
ultimately included in the review. These studies involved 206 patients, 166 of 
whom received mitapivat and the rest received placebo. Hemoglobin response was 
achieved by 38.0% to 80.0% of participants receiving mitapivat, with an average 
increase of 0.4 to 1.7 g/dL. Most studies reported improvements in bilirubin, 
lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, and reticulocyte levels. Adverse events 
(AEs) were experienced by 93.2% of participants, with rates of 93.97% and 89.7% 
in the intervention and control groups, respectively. However, most AEs were 
mild and transient, and 23.4% were graded as 3 or higher.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, PK activators, particularly mitapivat, demonstrated 
promising efficacy and safety profiles in managing hemolytic anemias. These 
agents significantly improved hemoglobin levels, markers of hemolysis, and 
hematopoietic response, offering a beneficial therapeutic option for various 
hemolytic conditions, including pyruvate kinase deficiency, sickle cell disease, 
and thalassemia.
REGISTRATION: A protocol was registered at the International Prospective 
Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) before study initiation, 
CRD42024598980.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare histiocytic disorder infrequently 
complicated by delayed-onset pituitary disease. A 41-year-old female presented 
with papular, acneiform skin lesions. Shave biopsy demonstrated a superficial 
dermal epithelioid cell proliferation with S100, CD1a, and langerin positivity 
on immunohistochemistry and a BRAF p.N486_P490del inframe deletion-gain of 
function pathogenic variant on next-generation sequencing. The skin lesions 
spontaneously resolved. One year later, she developed progressive fatigue, 
fevers, anorexia, menstrual irregularities, polyuria, and polydipsia. Laboratory 
workup was consistent with panhypopituitarism. Pituitary magnetic resonance 
imaging noted mass-like thickening and enhancement of the infundibulum extending 
toward the hypothalamus. After treatment with cobimetinib, magnetic resonance 
imaging findings resolved but endocrinopathies persisted, requiring indefinite 
hormone therapy. This case demonstrates the full spectrum of endocrinopathies of 
LCH-induced pituitary disease and is an unusual circumstance of LCH with 
delayed-onset panhypopituitarism.

BACKGROUND: Mitral valve disease (MVD) can have both rheumatic and nonrheumatic 
etiologies. However, differences in mortality remain unknown.
METHODS: We extracted age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 persons 
from the CDC WONDER database and stratified them by sex, region, and race. 
Annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) were 
calculated using Joinpoint regression. Pairwise comparison was used to identify 
significant differences for MVD mortality trends between rheumatic and 
nonrheumatic patients.
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2020, a total of 72,085 deaths were recorded in patients 
with rheumatic MVD, while 132,300 occurred in those with nonrheumatic MVD. The 
AAMR for nonrheumatic patients was twice as high as that for rheumatic patients 
throughout the study period, and AAPC differed significantly between the groups 
(p < 0.05). Females with rheumatic MVD were observed to have a higher AAMR (1.1) 
than their male counterparts (0.8), but those with nonrheumatic MVD exhibited a 
similar AAMR for both females and males. Among rheumatic patients, NH 
(non-hispanic) Whites were reported to have the highest AAMR (1.0), followed by 
NH Black or African Americans (0.8), Hispanic or Latinos (0.7), and NH Asian or 
Pacific Islanders (0.7). Among nonrheumatic patients, NH Whites exhibited the 
highest AAMR (1.9), followed by NH Black or African Americans (1.4), NH Asian or 
Pacific Islanders (1.1), and Hispanic or Latinos (1.0). The AAMR in Rural areas 
was higher than that in Urban areas for patients with both rheumatic and 
nonrheumatic MVD.
CONCLUSION: Comprehensive public health strategies are essential to improving 
survival outcomes.

BACKGROUND: The 1p/19q codeletion is a key genetic marker in gliomas and plays a 
crucial role in prognosis and treatment decisions. Traditional methods for 
detecting this genetic alteration rely on invasive tissue biopsies.
PURPOSE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the 
performance of MRI-derived radiomics-based models to predict glioma 1p/19q 
codeletion status.
DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted in 4 databases: PubMed, Web of 
Science, EMBASE, and Scopus.
STUDY SELECTION: We selected the studies that assessed the performance of 
radiomics-based models in determining 1p/19q codeletion status.
DATA ANALYSIS: The Methodological Radiomics Score was used to evaluate study 
quality. Pooled diagnostic estimates were calculated, and heterogeneity was 
assessed by using the I 2 statistic. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were 
performed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. Deek's funnel plot 
was used to assess publication bias.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria for the 
systematic review. A meta-analysis of 10 studies yielded a pooled sensitivity of 
0.82 (95% CI, 0.67-0.91), specificity of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.70-0.88), positive 
diagnostic likelihood (DLR) of 4.14 (95% CI, 2.62-6.52), negative DLR of 0.23 
(95% CI, 0.12-0.43), diagnostic odds ratio of 18.37 (95% CI, 7.36-45.85), and 
area under the curve of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84-0.90). Subgroup analysis revealed 
significant differences based on the country and segmentation method.
LIMITATIONS: Our meta-analysis is limited by small number of studies with 
external validation cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS: MRI-derived radiomics-based models demonstrated good predictive 
performance for glioma 1p/19q codeletion status, highlighting their potential as 
a noninvasive tool for glioma characterization and for aiding in treatment 
decision-making.

A digital twin is a computational model that provides a virtual representation 
of a specific physical object, system, or process and predicts its behavior at 
future time points. These simulation models form computational profiles for new 
diagnosis and prevention models. The digital twin is a concept borrowed from 
engineering. However, the rapid evolution of this technology has extended its 
application across various industries. In recent years, digital twins in 
healthcare have gained significant traction due to their potential to 
revolutionize medicine and drug development. In the context of radiology, 
digital twin technology can be applied in various areas, including optimizing 
medical device design, improving system performance, facilitating personalized 
medicine, conducting virtual clinical trials, and educating radiology trainees. 
Also, radiologic image data is a critical source of patient-specific measures 
that play a role in generating advanced intelligent digital twins. Generating a 
practical digital twin faces several challenges, including data availability, 
computational techniques, validation frameworks, and uncertainty quantification, 
all of which require collaboration among engineers, healthcare providers, and 
stakeholders. This review focuses on recent trends in digital twin technology 
and its intersection with radiology by reviewing applications, technological 
advancements, and challenges that need to be addressed for successful 
implementation in the field.

BACKGROUND: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is recommended as part of 
multimodality sampling in the evaluation of biliary strictures, but can be false 
negative in 40%-50% cases. The aim of this study was to comprehensively assess 
predictors of false-negative FISH in patients with biliary strictures.
METHODS: Patients undergoing tissue sampling for biliary strictures from October 
20 to February 22 were prospectively enrolled (NCT04572711). Procedural factors 
such as sampling techniques, order, and utilization of combination sampling were 
recorded. Results of an optimized pancreatobiliary FISH panel with 
locus-specific probes for 1q21, 7p12, 8q24, and 9p21 were reported per 
guidelines. Statistical analyses were performed using BlueSky Statistics 
v.10.3.1, R package v8.81.
RESULTS: Of 327 patients, 93 (28.5%) were diagnosed with malignancy. A 
false-negative pancreatobiliary fluorescence in situ hybridization (PB-FISH) was 
reported in 40 (43.1%) patients. A history of primary sclerosing cholangitis was 
associated with lower odds of having a false-negative PB-FISH (aOR=0.38, 95% 
CI=0.16-0.82, p=0.02), whereas a hilar stricture was associated with a 
significantly higher false-negative PB-FISH in those with cholangiocarcinoma 
(aOR=3.2 [1.4-7.9], p=0.009). Dilation of biliary strictures prior to brushing 
was not associated with a lower rate of false-negative PB-FISH.
CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study, hilar strictures were more likely to 
have false-negative PB-FISH. Dilation of strictures did not affect PB-FISH 
performance. These results can help guide PB-FISH interpretation.

INTRODUCTION: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the USA, 
contributing to increased risks of mortality and adverse cardiovascular events. 
While AF is predominantly seen in older adults, over 20% of cases occur in 
individuals younger than 65 years.
METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using de-identified data from 
the CDC WONDER database, covering all US deaths from 1999 to 2020. AF-related 
deaths were identified using ICD-10 codes. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) 
were calculated per 1 million population, standardized to the 2000 US census. 
Temporal trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression models with statistical 
significance set at p < 0.05.
RESULTS: From 1999 to 2020, 137,808 AF-related deaths were recorded among adults 
aged 15-64 years. The AAMR rose from 14.0 in 1999 to 50.5 by 2020, reflecting a 
6.3% annual increase. Adults aged 45-54 years showed the highest annual increase 
(6.7%), followed by adults aged 35-44 years (6.6%), and adults aged 55-64 years 
(6.2%). Males had a higher AAMR than females (35.4 vs 16.2). Non-Hispanic Blacks 
had the highest AAMR among racial groups (37.4). Rural areas showed higher AAMRs 
than urban areas (30.3 vs 24.6). AAMR varied widely across states, with Oklahoma 
having the highest rate (46.7).
CONCLUSION: AF-related mortality among younger US adults has significantly 
increased in the last 2 decades. The findings highlight the shifting 
epidemiology of AF, with middle-aged adults showing the highest annual 
increases.

BACKGROUND: Transvenous lead removal (TLR) is a Class I indication for patients 
with cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) infections. However, 
disparities in the utilization of TLR have not been fully explored, particularly 
concerning demographic and socioeconomic factors.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine whether disparities exist among patients 
hospitalized for CIED infections with respect to the utilization of TLR, 
focusing on sex, race, and income characteristics.
METHODS: We utilized the 2019 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) to assess patients 
hospitalized with CIED infections and identify those who underwent TLR. Multiple 
logistic regression was used to examine risk factors for TLR utilization, 
including age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic characteristics.
RESULTS: A total of 56 709 patients were hospitalized for CIED infection in the 
United States in 2019, of which 9867 (17.4%) underwent TLR. On an adjusted 
analysis, females and Black patients were found to have lower odds of undergoing 
TLR compared to males and White patients (OR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.59-0.78; p < 0.01; 
and OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.39-0.57; p < 0.01, respectively). Hispanic patients also 
had reduced odds of TLR (OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58-0.93; p = 0.01). No significant 
associations were observed between income or insurance status and the likelihood 
of receiving TLR after adjustment.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified significant disparities in the utilization of 
TLR among patients hospitalized for CIED infections. Female, Black, and Hispanic 
patients were significantly less likely to receive TLR.

OBJECTIVE: Chronic spinal degenerative diseases have been associated with 
reduced quality of life and dependency on others for personal needs and care. 
The change between preoperative and postoperative care dependency has yet to be 
explored in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM). In this 
retrospective study of a prospectively collected database, the authors evaluated 
the return to independence in performing self-care following surgical 
intervention for CSM.
METHODS: The CSM dataset of the Quality Outcomes Database (QOD) Spine CORe study 
group was queried. Care dependency was assessed using the personal care 
component of the Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire, having an ordinal 
scale from 0 to 5, with 5 representing the inability to independently perform 
activities of daily living. Numeric rating scale (NRS) scores for arm pain and 
neck pain were recorded at a 24-months postoperative follow-up. Multivariable 
logistic regression analyses were performed to identify baseline risk factors 
for an inability to care for oneself and the symptoms leading to care dependency 
at 24 months postoperatively. Satisfaction with surgery was measured using the 
4-point North American Spine Society (NASS) index.
RESULTS: Of the 1137 patients with CSM and baseline personal care scores, 167 
(14.7%) were care dependent at baseline (NDI personal care score ≥ 3). Patients 
with care dependency at baseline were predominantly Medicare beneficiaries and 
had a high school or lower level of education. Long-term follow-up rates for 
this study were 82.5% for NDI, 84.8% for patient satisfaction with surgery, 
82.4% for NRS arm pain, and 81.8% for NRS neck pain. Of the care-dependent 
patients, more than 80% became independently able to care for themselves by the 
24-month follow-up. Patients with resolved care dependency at 24 months had 
demonstrated lower baseline NDI and NRS neck pain scores (p < 0.01 for both). 
Neck pain was significantly associated with care dependency at 24 months' 
follow-up (p < 0.01). Patients who reported improvement in their ability to care 
for themselves noted higher postoperative satisfaction (NASS score 1-2) at the 
3-month (89.4% vs 80.2%, p < 0.01) and 24-month (88.2% vs 67.4%, p < 0.01) 
follow-ups.
CONCLUSIONS: Fifteen percent of patients with CSM depended on others for care 
preoperatively. After surgery to treat CSM, 81.8% of those who had depended on 
others for care became independent. Patients with improvements in care 
dependency noted higher postoperative satisfaction at the 3-month and 24-month 
follow-ups. Patients with resolved care dependency on long-term follow-up had 
lower NDI and NRS neck pain scores at baseline. Surgery had a significant impact 
on patients' attainment of independence.

CLINICAL QUESTION: What are the benefits and harms of medications for adults 
with type 2 diabetes at varied risks of cardiovascular and kidney related 
complications?
CONTEXT: Emerging clinical trials of novel medications have demonstrated 
benefits on cardiovascular, kidney, and weight related outcomes in people with 
type 2 diabetes. Dynamically updated practice guidelines adhering to standards 
of trustworthiness are necessary in response to a rapidly evolving evidence base 
and the availability of multiple medication alternatives. This living practice 
guideline incorporates the latest available medications and evidence and 
provides recommendations stratified by risks of cardiovascular and kidney 
complications to inform diabetes management.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The panel issued risk-stratified recommendations regarding four 
prioritised medications for adults with type 2 diabetes (SGLT-2 inhibitors, 
GLP-1 receptor agonists, finerenone and tirzepatide):• Lower risk (three or 
fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)): weak recommendation against SGLT-2 
inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Moderate risk (more than three 
cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD; or established CVD 
and/or CKD at lower risk of complications): weak recommendation in favour of 
SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation against 
finerenone in adults with CKD.• Higher risk (established CVD and/or CKD at 
higher risk of complications, or established heart failure): strong 
recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a 
weak recommendation in favour of finerenone in adults with CKD.• Across risk 
strata: weak recommendation in favour of tirzepatide in adults with obesity.
ABOUT THIS GUIDELINE AND HOW IT WAS CREATED: An international panel including 
two patient partners, clinicians, and methodologists produced these 
recommendations. The panel followed standards for trustworthy guidelines and 
used the GRADE approach, explicitly considering the balance of benefits, harms 
and burdens of treatment from an individual patient perspective. Recommendations 
were informed by a linked living systematic review and network meta-analysis 
evaluating relative benefits and harms updated to 31 July 2024; and by linked 
systematic reviews addressing risk prediction models and values and preferences 
of adults with type 2 diabetes. Candidate therapeutics are prioritised based on 
availability of sufficient randomised trial data, relevance to a global audience 
and likelihood of changing practice.This is the first version of the living 
guideline. The guideline is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations series. 
MAGICapp displays the most recent version of the guideline and full content 
including evidence summaries and decision aids; major updates will be published 
in The BMJ. We encourage re-use, adaptation and translation of these living 
guidelines, and recognise that the lack of availability or high costs of some 
medications may be prohibitive and will impact on how these recommendations are 
implemented across different health care systems.

Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is a rare mesenchymal neoplasm of 
borderline malignancy (locally recurring, rarely metastasizing), most often 
involving the limbs, trunk, and head/neck. Rarely, AFH may involve unusual 
locations. Herein, we characterize the clinicopathologic features of 26 AFH of 
the distal extremities, including acral sites. The tumors occurred in 19 females 
and 7 males ranging in age from 12 to 76 years (median, 23 years). Tumors 
involved the upper (n = 19) and lower (n = 6) distal extremity; one affected an 
unspecified digital site. Twenty-two cases occurred in acral locations (hands 
and feet). Subsets of cases showed the following morphologic features: 
multinodular architecture (26/26), lymphoid cuffs (23/26), prominent stromal 
myxoid change (11/25), angiomatoid features (9/26), and cytologic pleomorphism 
(8/26). The average mitotic count was 1/10 HPF; 3 cases showed brisk mitotic 
activity (> 10 mitoses/10 HPF). Immunohistochemistry revealed variable 
expression of desmin (16/25), EMA (14/21) and ALK (5/8). Molecular testing 
revealed EWSR1 rearrangements in 17/18 cases (94%). Among 12 tumors with known 
fusion partners, the fusions partner was CREB1 in 6 cases (50%), CREM in 4 
tumors (33%), ATF1 in one tumor (8%) and PBX3 (8%) in another tumor. Prominent 
myxoid features were noted in 75% CREM versus 33% of CREB1 versus 0% of 
ATF1-fused tumors. AFH occurring in distal extremity/acral locations have a 
predilection for females, upper extremity locations, frequent unusual (solid, 
non-angiomatoid and myxoid) morphology and higher frequency of CREM over ATF1 
fusions. Awareness of the morphologic spectrum of these rare neoplasms is 
essential for correct classification.

Human pluripotent stem cell-derived kidney organoids have demonstrated utility 
in modeling kidney development and genetic disease. Autosomal recessive 
polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is an inherited developmental cystic kidney 
disease of high morbidity and mortality that lacks directed therapy. To overcome 
the limitations of animal models and stimulate drug discovery, ARPKD organoids 
have previously been subject to well-described cystogenic mechanisms for use in 
therapeutic screens. Although these studies have validated genotype-phenotype 
correlations and cystogenic response of ARPKD organoids as similar to existing 
in vitro models, novel cystogenic mechanisms that expand potential therapeutic 
targets have yet to be uncovered. Here we use a combination of human induced 
pluripotent stem cell-derived ARPKD and isogenic wild-type organoids, native 
kidney and organoid single-cell RNA sequencing, decedent human ARPKD tissue, and 
targeted mechanistic studies to describe PTH1R as a stimulatory 
G-protein-coupled receptor, which instigates a cystogenic signaling cascade in 
developmental cystic kidney disease. Our findings demonstrate the utility of 
kidney organoids as an in vitro model for pathomechanisms of rare diseases, 
which lack faithful animal models.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Stem cell-derived kidney 
organoids enable human genetic disease modeling to identify the parathyroid 
hormone 1 receptor as a potential new therapeutic target for developmental 
polycystic kidney disease.

BACKGROUND: Primary aldosteronism (PA), a primary adrenal disorder leading to 
excessive aldosterone production by one or both adrenal glands, is a common 
cause of hypertension. It is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular 
complications compared with primary hypertension. Despite effective methods for 
diagnosing and treating PA, it remains markedly underdiagnosed and undertreated.
OBJECTIVE: To develop an updated guideline that provides a practical, clinical 
approach to identifying and managing PA to improve diagnosis rates and encourage 
targeted treatment.
METHODS: The Guideline Development Panel (GDP), composed of a multidisciplinary 
panel of clinical experts and experts in systemic review methodology, used the 
Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) 
approach to define 10 questions related to the diagnosis and treatment of PA. 
Systematic reviews were conducted for each question. The GDP used the GRADE 
Evidence to Decision (EtD) framework to consider contextual factors, such as 
stakeholder values and preferences, costs and required resources, 
cost-effectiveness, acceptability, feasibility, and the potential impact on 
health equity.
RESULTS: We suggest that all individuals with hypertension be screened for PA by 
measuring aldosterone and renin and determining the aldosterone to renin ratio, 
and that subsequent clinical care be guided by the results. We suggest that 
individuals with PA receive PA-specific therapy, either medical or surgical. In 
individuals who screen positive for PA, we suggest (1) commencement of 
PA-specific medical therapy in individuals who do not desire or are not 
candidates for surgery and in situations where the probability of lateralizing 
PA (excess aldosterone produced by one adrenal) is low based on screening 
results; and (2) aldosterone suppression testing in situations when screening 
results indicate an intermediate probability for lateralizing PA and 
individualized decision making confirms a desire to pursue eligibility for 
surgical therapy. In those who test positive by aldosterone suppression testing, 
and in those in whom screening results show a high probability of lateralizing 
PA (obviating the need for aldosterone suppression testing), we suggest adrenal 
lateralization with computed tomography scanning and adrenal venous sampling 
prior to deciding the treatment approach (medical vs surgical). In all 
individuals with PA and an adrenal adenoma, we suggest performing a 1-mg 
overnight dexamethasone suppression test. We suggest the use of 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) over epithelial sodium-channel 
(ENaC) inhibitors in the medical treatment of PA. We suggest the use of 
spironolactone over other MRAs, given its lower cost and greater availability; 
however, all MRAs, when titrated to equivalent potencies, are anticipated to 
have similar efficacy in treating PA. Thus, MRAs with greater mineralocorticoid 
receptor specificity and fewer androgen/progesterone receptor-mediated side 
effects may be preferred in some situations. In individuals receiving MRA 
therapy, we suggest monitoring renin and, in those whose hypertension remains 
uncontrolled and renin is suppressed, titrating the MRA to increase renin.
CONCLUSION: These recommendations provide a practical framework for the 
diagnosis and treatment of PA. They are based on currently available literature 
and take into consideration outcomes that are important to key stakeholders. The 
goal is to increase identification of individuals with PA and, by initiating 
PA-specific medical or surgical therapy, improve blood pressure control and 
reduce PA-associated adverse cardiovascular events. The guidelines also 
highlight important knowledge gaps in PA diagnosis and management.

Opioids are often prescribed to children for pain relief related to procedures, 
acute injuries, and chronic conditions. Around-the-clock dosing of opioids can 
produce physiologic opioid dependence within 5 days. According to a 2001 
consensus paper from the American Academy of Pain Medicine, American Pain 
Society, and American Society of Addiction Medicine, dependence is defined as "a 
state of adaptation that is manifested by a drug class specific withdrawal 
syndrome that can be produced by abrupt cessation, rapid dose reduction, 
decreasing blood level of the drug, or administration of an antagonist." The 
experience of children undergoing iatrogenic withdrawal symptoms is variable and 
may be mild and go unreported or can be severe and even life threatening. 
Guidance on opioid withdrawal is available only for adults and primarily for 
adults with substance use disorders. This report will summarize existing 
literature and provide readers with information on how to screen for symptoms of 
iatrogenic opioid withdrawal as well as mechanisms for opioid withdrawal 
prevention.

Tissue viscoelasticity is becoming an increasingly useful biomarker beyond 
elasticity and can theoretically be estimated using shear wave elastography by 
inverting the propagation and attenuation characteristics of shear waves. 
Estimating viscosity is often more difficult than elasticity because 
attenuation, the main effect of viscosity, leads to poor signal-to-noise ratio 
of the shear wave motion. In the present work, we provide an alternative to 
existing methods of viscoelasticity estimation, based on peaks in the 
frequency-wavenumber (f-k) domain, which are considered more robust against 
noise compared with other features in the f-k domain. Specifically, the method 
minimizes the difference between simulated and measured versions of two sets of 
peaks (twin peaks) in the f-k domain, obtained first by traversing through each 
frequency and then by traversing through each wavenumber. The slopes and 
deviation of the twin peaks are sensitive to elasticity and viscosity, 
respectively, leading to the effectiveness of the proposed inversion algorithm 
for characterizing mechanical properties. This expected effectiveness is 
confirmed through in silico verification, followed by ex vivo validation and in 
vivo application, indicating that the proposed approach can be used effectively 
in accurately estimating viscoelasticity, thus potentially contributing to the 
development of enhanced biomarkers.

Background: Building on the 2017 Compendium of Health and Wellness Coaching 
(HWC) and its 2019 Addendum, the 2023 Addendum extends the scope of research by 
incorporating studies published from 2018 to 2022. This latest version continues 
to serve as a vital resource for practitioners and researchers, offering access 
to a comprehensive collection of studies spanning established and emerging 
health domains. Methods: The 2023 Addendum updates and expands the evidence base 
to evaluate HWC's effectiveness across various conditions and settings. In this 
iteration, an expanded range of literature databases was explored to ensure 
inclusivity, categorizing articles into eight established health conditions-such 
as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity-while introducing two new categories 
reflecting research trends in respiratory conditions and chronic pain 
management. Results: The addendum includes findings from 212 articles, among 
which 115 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate the effectiveness of 
HWC in improving patient-centered outcomes such as chronic care management, 
medication adherence, self-efficacy, and quality of life. Positive impacts were 
also documented on surrogate biomarkers, particularly in diabetes, hypertension, 
and cardiovascular care. All articles, including reviews and commentaries, are 
indexed with detailed methodologies and findings in an accessible spreadsheet 
format. Conclusions: Since its first iteration in 2017, the Compendium has grown 
to encompass over 480 articles, including more than 140 RCTs, illustrating the 
expanding role of HWC in health care. This evidence base underscores HWC's 
utility as a key intervention for chronic disease management, preventive care, 
and whole-person health. Future research should focus on refining coaching 
methodologies, evaluating long-term outcomes, and exploring cost-effectiveness 
to enhance HWC's delivery and impact across diverse populations and settings.

BACKGROUND: Around 40% of patients diagnosed with Primary Biliary Cholangitis 
(PBC) experience a suboptimal biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid 
(UDCA).
AIMS: We aimed to compare fibrates and obeticholic acid (OCA) as add-on 
second-line therapy and evaluate whether these drugs hold superiority over each 
other.
METHODS: We systematically searched Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane CENTRAL for 
studies comparing fibrates and OCA published by May 6, 2024. A pooled analysis 
was conducted to evaluate changes in liver biochemistry and response rates based 
on validated criteria. Data were expressed as mean difference (MD) for 
continuous outcomes and as Odds Ratio (OR) when binary.
RESULTS: We included 883 patients from 4 studies, 468 (53.0%) under UDCA + OCA. 
Follow-up time ranged from 6 to 12 months. Patients treated with fibrates have 
similar mean bilirubin post-intervention values (MD 0.11 × upper limit of normal 
[ULN]; 95% CI - 0.26 to 0.49) compared to OCA. However, fibrates demonstrated 
superiority over OCA for percentual reduction in ALP compared to baseline (MD 
20.13%; 95% CI 11.84-28.41), ALP post-intervention values (MD - 0.59 xULN; 95% 
CI - 1.02 to - 0.15), and rate of ALP normalization (OR 32.34; 95% CI 
14.54-71.92). Patients treated with fibrates also more frequently met Barcelona 
(OR 4.28; 95% CI 2.26-8.11), POISE (OR 5.48; 95% CI 2.70-11.13), and Paris II 
(OR 5.88; 95% CI 3.96-8.74) response criteria.
CONCLUSION: In patients with PBC and an incomplete response to UDCA, fibrates 
seem to be associated with greater ALP reduction and achievement of response 
criteria compared to OCA.

BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab therapy carries a risk of acute cardiotoxicity, 
particularly when combined with anthracyclines. To date, no study has assessed 
hypertension as a potential long-term adverse effect of trastuzumab therapy in 
adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors.
METHODS: We identified all female AYAs aged 15-39 years diagnosed with first 
primary invasive breast cancer between 2006 and 2020 in Kaiser Permanente 
Northern and Southern California, who survived at least 2 years post-diagnosis. 
Patients were categorized into two groups: those who received chemotherapy plus 
trastuzumab and those who received chemotherapy alone. We examined hypertension 
occurrence starting 2 years post-diagnosis, compared the 2-5-year cumulative 
incidence of hypertension between the trastuzumab and non-trastuzumab groups, 
and evaluated associated risk factors.
RESULTS: Among 2382 female AYAs with breast cancer, 33.0% received trastuzumab. 
The 2-5-year cumulative incidence of hypertension did not differ between the 
trastuzumab (6.79%, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 4.96-8.99%) and non-trastuzumab 
(7.85%, CI 6.41-9.48%) groups, p = 0.67. Trastuzumab was not associated with 
hypertension (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.01, CI 0.731-1.38) in multivariable 
analysis. Factors associated with higher hypertension included older age at 
diagnosis (35-39 vs. 15-34y), non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic Asian 
race/ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic White), overweight or obesity (vs. underweight 
or normal weight), smoking, and endocrine therapy. History of diabetes and 
dyslipidemia showed borderline association with hypertension.
CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab was not associated with new-onset hypertension among AYA 
breast cancer survivors. However, sociodemographic and clinical factors 
significantly contributed to hypertension risk, highlighting the importance of 
interventions targeting modifiable risk factors.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this invited expert guide is to discuss options for 
complex reconstruction for patients presenting with esophageal discontinuity, 
loss of a gastric conduit, fistula, or other complex esophageal conditions.
METHODS: On the basis of a series of complex esophageal reconstructions in 
adults, from multiple institutions, solutions are reviewed and organized by 
conduit, circumstance, and technique. Patient-specific data are excluded, and 
the scenarios focus on a summarized presentation of options.
RESULTS: Surgical techniques for esophageal salvage reconstruction and revision 
are discussed. Esophageal salvage includes stenting, endoscopic vacuum therapy, 
plication, dilation, assisted emptying, untwisting, endoluminal repair, and 
operative revision. Esophageal reconstruction includes a variety of routes, 
timing, and conduits for replacement. Three predominant reconstruction 
approaches are reviewed, including local or primary options, interposition 
grafts, and tissue-engineered constructs.
CONCLUSIONS: A standard tubularized pedicled gastric conduit is the first choice 
for esophageal reconstruction. Attempts to salvage leaks and initial esophageal 
reconstruction conduits should be made before selecting a secondary option. 
Complex reconstruction can be staged by diversion and later reconstruction when 
nontraditional conduits are used. The esophagus can be successfully 
reconstructed from small bowel, colon, myocutaneous, cutaneous, or biomatrix 
material.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the value of cytokine, chemokine, and neurofilament 
light chain (NfL) concentrations in predicting relapse risk, chronic epilepsy, 
and functional impairment in LGI1 autoimmune encephalitis (AE).
METHODS: Cytokines/chemokines (IL-1-beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, 
IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CXCL9, CXCL10, 
CXCL13, BAFF) and NfL concentrations were measured in CSF and paired serum from 
LGI1-AE patients evaluated at Mayo Clinic (01/2015-02/2024), using a multiplex 
immunoassay system (ELLA, Bio-Techne) and correlated with clinical outcomes. A 
laboratory-based cohort of LGI1-IgG-positive patients and control cohorts, 
including patients with mixed non-inflammatory disorders (MNID), Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients with LGI1-AE were included; 29 (66%) were male, 
with a median age of 68.5 years (range, 8-85). Median time from symptom onset to 
CSF sampling was eight months (IQR, 3-17); 19/42 (45%) experienced a clinical 
relapse and 27% developed chronic epilepsy. Serum IL-6, serum and CSF 
IL-8/CXCL8, and IL-17A were higher in LGI1-IgG positive patients than MNID 
(p < 0.05). TLE cytokine/chemokine profiles were similar to LGI1 AE; AD patients 
had lower serum IL-6 and CSF IL-8/CXCL8 (p = 0.04; p = 0.01), and higher serum 
IL-17A and GM-CSF (p = 0.004; p = 0.01) than LGI1-AE. Higher CSF IL-6 and 
IL-8/CXCL8 in LGI1-AE associated with clinical relapse (p < 0.05) and higher CSF 
NfL associated with chronic epilepsy (p = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Elevations in IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, and IL-17A were identified in this 
LGI1-AE cohort. CSF IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, and NfL levels are potential prognostic 
biomarkers for risk of relapse and chronic epilepsy in LGI1-AE.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to develop a U.S.-specific reference equation for the 
6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) in individuals with Class III obesity and compare its 
performance with the Italian model by Capodaglio et al. The goal was to provide 
clinicians with a more accurate tool for assessing functional capacity.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on 307 adults with Class III 
obesity referred to outpatient physical therapy from 2017 to 2023. Of these, 295 
completed the 6MWT. Multiple linear regression was used to build a predictive 
model using age, sex, and BMI as independent variables. The model was validated 
via internal cross-validation and compared with Capodaglio et al.'s equation. 
Subgroup analyses by age group were also conducted.
RESULTS: The final model included age, BMI, and gender, explaining 41% of the 
variance in 6MWT distance. The mean absolute error was 53.2 meters, and the 
Spearman correlation was 0.67. Compared to Capodaglio's model, ours predicted 
6.52% lower distances overall, with the largest differences in adults over 60.
CONCLUSION: The new U.S.-based model provides more accurate 6MWT predictions for 
individuals with Class III obesity, particularly older adults. It may help guide 
functional assessment and pre/post-metabolic and bariatric surgery care in this 
population.

Plain Language Summary: The six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is a practical tool for 
assessing functional capacity in individuals with Class III obesity, but 
existing reference equations may not be applicable to this population.This study 
provides the first U.S.-specific 6MWT reference equation for individuals with 
Class III obesity, improving the accuracy of functional assessments in clinical 
and rehabilitation settings.The new equation may improve the monitoring of 
functional recovery over time, especially in older adults and individuals with 
severe mobility limitations, by providing more individualized reference values 
and supporting clinicians in setting realistic goals and tracking progress after 
metabolic and bariatric surgery.

BACKGROUND: Up to 80% of persons with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) have dysphagia. 
However, existing studies are based on small cohorts and the relationship 
between dysphagia and other motor and nonmotor symptoms (NMS) remains 
incompletely understood.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between motor and NMS in PwPD with vs 
without dysphagia.
METHODS: Among 20,365 PwPD in the Michael J. Fox Foundation database who 
completed ≥2 NMS surveys, 12,678 (62%) reported dysphagia on ≥1 survey. We 
examined associations between dysphagia and: (1) self-reported motor symptoms 
(UPDRS Part II), other NMS, quality of life (QoL), comorbidity score, 
depression, and daily activities at baseline; and (2) development of new NMS.
RESULTS: Compared to PwPD without dysphagia, those with dysphagia were more 
likely to have had PD for >5 years, more severe motor and NMS, higher 
comorbidity scores, and a greater impairment in daily activities (P < 0.001). 
The prevalence of dysphagia increased with the severity of motor symptoms at the 
index survey (P < 0.001). At baseline, all NMS were significantly associated 
with dysphagia. Compared to PwPD who did not have dysphagia, PwPD with dysphagia 
were at increased risk of developing every NMS, even after adjusting for ages at 
PD diagnosis and index survey, sex, cognitive impairment, UPDRS, NMS and 
comorbidity scores. For most NMS, the risk of progression was greater in those 
with cognitive impairment or elevated NMS scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Dysphagia in PwPD is associated with more severe motor and 
non-motor symptoms, reduced QoL, and an increased risk of future NMS.

BACKGROUND: Contemporary data elucidates an association between adverse outcomes 
and low socioeconomic status (SES) in patients with cardiovascular related 
hospitalizations. Despite this, the impact of SES status on infective 
endocarditis (IE) outcomes remains unknown.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of SES on hospitalized IE cases.
METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Readmission Database (2016-2020) to identify 
adult patients with IE and stratified them based on mean income quartiles (≤2 
quartile vs. ≥3 quartiles). The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. 
Secondary outcomes included 30-day and 90-day readmissions, sepsis, mechanical 
circulatory support (MCS) use, acute kidney injury (AKI), pacemaker and valve 
replacement interventions, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges. 
Multivariable regression models adjusted for confounders.
RESULTS: Among 41,175 IE hospitalizations, 24,581 (59.7 %) included patients 
with low income. Low income was associated with higher odds of in-hospital 
mortality (aOR 1.21, 95 % CI 1.04-1.41, p = 0.012), 30-day readmissions (aOR 
1.09, 95 % CI 1.01-1.17, p = 0.021), 90-day readmissions (aOR 1.1, 95 % CI 
1.02-1.19, p = 0.012), sepsis (aOR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.03-1.19, p = 0.008), MCS use 
(aOR 1.48, 95 % CI 1.04-2.09, p = 0.027) and lower odds of stroke (aOR 0.86, 95 
% CI 0.78-0.96, p = 0.005) compared with high-income. No differences were 
observed in odds of AKI, valve replacement intervention, pacemaker use, mean LOS 
and total hospital charges between both income groups.
CONCLUSION: Among IE hospitalizations, lower income was associated with higher 
odds of in-hospital mortality and non-fatal adverse outcomes compared to higher 
income individuals.

OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of 
uterine isthmoceles, as well as to highlight potential variations and 
complications.
DESIGN: Narrated video of surgical technique with descriptions of key steps. 
This video article was deemed by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) to not require IRB review. The authors report no conflicts of interest.
SUBJECTS: Patients with isthmoceles desiring future fertility. The patients 
included in this video gave consent for publication of the video and posting of 
the video online including social media, the journal website, scientific 
literature websites (such as PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, etc.) and other 
applicable sites.
EXPOSURE: Robot assisted laparoscopy or hysteroscopy.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete surgical repair of isthmoceles via robot 
assisted laparoscopy or hysteroscopy as well as management of isthmocele 
variations and complications.
RESULTS: The presentation and imaging findings of isthmoceles are reviewed. 
Surgical videos are then used to demonstrate the principles of surgical 
management of isthmoceles, both laparoscopically and hysteroscopically. 
Variations and complications of isthmoceles, and their associated surgical 
management, are also reviewed. Key surgical techniques include: Careful 
identification of isthmocele and surrounding anatomy Adequate dissection of 
vital structures is key for visualization and hemostasis Injection of dilute 
vasopressin to minimize bleeding Placement of a uterine manipulator or sound to 
delineate the endometrial cavity prior to repair Pre and post hysteroscopy to 
visualize defect and subsequent repair CONCLUSION: Key surgical techniques can 
be applied to the repair of isthmoceles in typical locations. However, there are 
unique anatomic and surgical considerations when approaching variations and 
complications of isthmoceles.
